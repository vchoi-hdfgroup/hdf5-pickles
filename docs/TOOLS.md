harnesses, and generated artifacts, see the
[tool relationship overview](tool-overview.md).

## Command Entry Points

The top-level `tools/` directory collects repository commands.  Most entries are
relative symlinks to the tool-owned implementations:

```text
tools/h5explain          -> ../h5explain/tools/h5explain
tools/h5patch            -> ../h5patch/tools/h5patch
tools/h5policy           -> ../h5policy/tools/h5policy
tools/h5policy-diff      -> ../h5policy/tools/h5policy-diff
tools/h5policy-fuzz      -> ../h5policy/tools/h5policy-fuzz

```

`tools/pkdoc.py`, `tools/check_tutorial.py`, `tools/check_markdown_links.py`,
`tools/check_tool_overview.py`, `tools/check_objectstore_example.py`,
`tools/finding_registry.py`, `tools/check_registry.py`,
`tools/message_routing.py`, `tools/h5cve`, and `tools/h5cve-corpus` are
repository-level helper scripts (not symlinks). They generate and test documentation, load and check
the sharded finding registry and its message routes, and orchestrate the CVE
case workflow described below.

`pkdoc.py` generates the format pages and landing page from executable pickles,
prose sidecars, and the checked Version 4.0 hierarchy in `docs/spec/index.yml`.
Its check mode also rejects stale generated Markdown and invalid section,
coverage, layout, or anchor mappings.

## h5cve-corpus External Specimen Manifest

`tools/h5cve-corpus` checks h5policy against an external CVE specimen corpus
that this repository does **not** vendor. The bytes are megabytes of
unregenerable blobs against a smaller repository pack, and `run.sh` guarantees
that tracked fixtures reproduce byte for byte — a guarantee nobody here can hold
for files nobody here can regenerate. So `registry/cve-corpus-manifest.yml`
travels and the specimens do not; point the tool at a sibling checkout.

```
h5cve-corpus --corpus DIR                      # verify against the manifest
h5cve-corpus --corpus DIR --hdf5 DIR \
             --revision REV --regenerate       # rewrite it
```

It **exits 0 when the corpus is absent**, so it is skip-not-fail by
construction. `run.sh` runs it as the `cvecorpus` phase when a sibling checkout
is present (about 90 seconds for 140 specimens); set `H5POLICY_CVE_CORPUS` to
point elsewhere, or to the **empty string** to disable it.

**It guards the accepts, not the rejections.** Triage of that corpus is
finished. Its remaining value is that roughly a dozen specimens accept *on
purpose* — their defects are dataset raw data, filter decode, teardown, or a
field libhdf5 itself writes out of range — and each such accept is a
load-bearing negative expectation on genuinely hostile input. A future check
that starts rejecting one has produced a suspected invariant-A false positive on
a real attacker's file rather than on a fixture written here.

Only `decision` is a contract. The finding list is informational and regenerated
wholesale, because a new check firing on an already-rejected file is not drift
and comparing it would make the manifest churn on every commit. `base` is a
mechanical same-size, fewest-differing-bytes match against the HDF5 source tree,
which is what makes an upstream CVE description checkable — a title can name a
function the specimen's own bytes cannot reach. `triage` is the judgement, is
carried forward across regeneration, and reads `untriaged` wherever nobody has
made one: a rejecting specimen is in the safe direction, not an examined one.

## h5cve Case Orchestrator

`tools/h5cve` chains the existing tools into one provenance-stamped CVE case
bundle and auto-populates the [`registry/cve-case.yml`](../registry/cve-case.yml)
schema.  It duplicates no tool logic — it shells out to `h5policy`, `h5markers`,
`h5explain`, and the exact-build probe, and maps the primary finding to its
invariant through [`registry/findings/`](../registry/findings/).

```text
h5cve init  <id> --poc FILE                 # bundle: PoC, sha256, case.yml, advisory draft
h5cve triage <case>                         # oracle + census + registry mapping
h5cve verify <case> --baseline BINDIR [--candidate BINDIR]   # exact-build probes
h5cve variants <case> [--seed VALID]        # typed semantic variants via h5mutate
h5cve minimize <case>                        # deferred: structure-aware reducer
h5cve promote <case>                        # draft tests expectation + registry case
h5cve census <root>                         # read-only oracle census of an HDF5 tree
h5cve matrix [--baseline BINDIR] [--output F]  # exact-build canary matrix
h5cve evidence [--matrix F]                 # measured libhdf5 verdict per family
h5cve verification                          # §12 requirement status per family
```

`triage` names the violated invariant from the primary finding. Ambiguous
finding codes are emitted by more than one walker, so the mapping is resolved
with the finding **message** via grouped rules in
`registry/findings/routes/`. When no rule matches, triage asserts **nothing**
and reports the candidate families instead — an unnamed invariant is a visible
gap, a wrong one is a wrong fix.
Production codes that have not reached that semantic review are source-tracked
in `registry/finding-backlog.yml`; triage deliberately leaves their mapping
unset until they move into the finding catalog.

`init` also creates `github-advisory.md`, a private handoff draft matching the
repository-advisory form. Complete it only from measured case evidence, compare
it with the authenticated form before submission, and treat creating or
publishing an advisory as a separate user-authorized action.

`triage` also records **every** family the file implicates, not just the
primary's, in `family_coverage`.  The strict profile stops at the first
rejection, so on a file with several unrelated defects `record` names one family
and a single canary would be all `verify` ever ran — a `verified` canary is then
a statement about one finding, not about the file.  The forensic profile
continues after rejection, so its finding list is the superset triage resolves.
`verify` runs a canary for each of those families and reports one row apiece;
a family with no canary is reported as an explicit `coverage_gap` row rather
than omitted, and a forbidden activation in any of them fails the command.

## Exact-Build Canary Matrix

`h5cve matrix` runs the selected libhdf5 build against every corpus fixture that
declares an `h5cve` contract, and reports one row per fixture/family:

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `verified` | the family exercise ran and every required entry point succeeded |
| `unexercised` | the exercise was selected but did not complete — typically because libhdf5 rejected the file, which is the expected result for a malformed fixture |
| `violation` | a forbidden activation occurred, or the build diverged from the oracle where the fixture requires alignment |
| `coverage_gap` | no canary exists for that family, or the fixture declares no contract |

[`registry/h5cve-matrix-policy.yml`](../registry/h5cve-matrix-policy.yml) pins which
statuses each fixture may report; the matrix exits non-zero on anything else. A
fixture must state its family and permitted statuses explicitly, so a new canary
or a changed traversal surface cannot silently inherit a passing outcome.

Only `reject_corrupt` is compared against the build for alignment.
`reject_resource` and `reject_policy` are decisions about the selected *profile*
— a traversal budget or a denied feature — which libhdf5 has no equivalent of,
so those rows report `not_comparable` rather than a divergence.

A canary that passes on a valid fixture does not show it could detect a defect.
Each family therefore also needs a malformed fixture that libhdf5 opens
successfully and that carries the family's defect: one rejected at `H5Fopen`
never reaches the family surface at all.

<!-- canary-family-inventory: 16/16 -->

All **16 of 16** record families have a canary, and each has such a malformed,
open-successfully specimen. `tools/check_quickstart.py` derives and checks this
inventory from `tools/h5cve` and `registry/validation-coverage.yml` as part of
`docs-check`.

`h5cve evidence` turns a matrix run into a per-family verdict on the selected
build (`enforced`, `partial`, `diverges`, `unmeasured`) and writes
[`registry/libhdf5-evidence.yml`](../registry/libhdf5-evidence.yml). Faults and
non-terminations reach it as separate `crashes_on` and `hangs_on` buckets: the
probe forbids one `crash` event for both, so the split is read off its
`outcome`, and a hang reported as a crash would name a fault the specimen never
caused. That file is
the **measurement**; `validation-coverage.yml`'s `validators.hdf5` is the
hand-maintained **claim**, and `tools/check_registry.py` fails on any
disagreement — so a claim about libhdf5 cannot drift from what was observed.
Regenerate after changing the build under test or the corpus:

```sh
tools/h5cve evidence --libhdf5-version 2.3.0    # ~8s, runs the matrix itself
```

`h5cve verification` scores each family against the eleven §12 verification
requirements and writes
[`registry/verification-coverage.yml`](../registry/verification-coverage.yml).
Statuses are `met`, `partial`, `absent` or `not_assessed` — the last is not a
soft `met`, and requirements that would need fixtures classified by hand are
marked that way rather than inferred. `check_registry.py` enforces that every
record is scored on every requirement, but not the scores themselves: the file
measures distance from §12 rather than gating on it.

## Truncation Sweep

Every prefix of a valid file is a file an attacker can hand you, and each one
must be *decided*: `h5policy` has to terminate with a verdict rather than escape
with an exception, hang, or report an internal error.
`tools/h5policy-truncate` walks those prefixes and asserts exactly that.

```sh
tools/h5policy-truncate h5policy/tests/valid/*.h5      # exhaustive, minutes
tools/h5policy-truncate --max-prefixes 512 SEED...     # bounded
```

Analysis runs **in-process** through the `h5policy_analyze` seam, all prefixes
in one poke session: ~250 prefixes/second against ~2/second for the CLI, which
is what makes an exhaustive sweep practical at all.

Coverage is reported per seed as `exhaustive` (every byte boundary) or `sampled`
(the budget forced striding, spending half of it on every boundary of the
metadata-dense head). A sampled sweep is not an exhaustive one and does not
satisfy §12. `run.sh` runs a bounded subset as a regression check; the full
corpus sweep is on-demand, like the fuzzer.

Results land in [`registry/truncation-sweep.json`](../registry/truncation-sweep.json),
which `h5cve verification` reads to score the §12 truncation requirement.

## Lazy-Validation Measurement

"Validation remains lazy" is falsifiable: the cost of validating a file must be
a function of its **metadata**, not of how much raw data it carries.
`tools/h5policy-lazy` measures that on the report's deterministic counters —
`metadata_bytes_seen` and `walk_operations` — rather than wall-clock, which is
dominated by interpreter startup and too noisy to assert on.

```sh
tools/h5policy-lazy                                  # human-readable
tools/h5policy-lazy --output registry/lazy-validation.json
```

Fixture creation uses `libver=latest` with root-group and dataset timestamp
tracking explicitly disabled. This keeps object-header sizes independent of
h5py/HDF5 defaults.

Three ladders, and the third is what makes the first two mean anything:

| ladder | varies | expectation |
|---|---|---|
| `data` | 16 → 1,600,000 elements (100,000×); physical file 2,112 → 6,402,048 bytes (3,031×), structure fixed | counters flat |
| `filtered` | same element-count ladder with deflate and **one chunk throughout**; physical file 2,088 → 2,214,864 bytes (1,061×) | counters flat — a validator that decompressed to inspect payload would show it |
| `chunks` | chunk count 4 → 400 (100×) — real metadata growth | `walk_operations` **must rise** |

Without the control, flat counters could equally mean the counters are broken.
The `filtered` ladder pins the chunk count deliberately: letting it vary with
`n` would measure metadata growth rather than data volume.

The control's rise is steeply superlinear, and deliberately so: the extent
checks behind `chunk.data_disjoint_from_metadata` and
`chunk.data_disjoint_from_data` compare each data extent against those recorded
so far, which is quadratic in chunk count until their caps are reached. It is
bounded, not runaway — measured on one-element-chunk files, `walk_operations`
goes 60,786 (256 chunks) → 629,909 (1,024) and then flattens to 724,346 (2,048)
and 920,679 (4,096) once the 1,024-check cap engages, i.e. ~9% of the tightest
profile's 10,000,000-operation budget rather than an unbounded term.
`analysis.extent_overlap_truncated` reports when a cap was reached, so a clean
result from those checks can be told apart from a partial one.

Counters are bounded by ratio, not equality — decoding a larger stored-size
field can cost a few operations without any payload being touched, while a
validator that read payload would grow with `n`. In the current tracked
measurement, the unfiltered ladder's `metadata_bytes_seen`/`walk_operations`
remain exactly 447/225 across the 3,031× physical-file increase. The filtered
ladder remains at 447 metadata bytes while operations move only 253 → 257
across 1,061× physical growth. The sensitivity control rises
416 → 2,018 → 89,318 operations. These ratios are derived from the
`physical_bytes` endpoints in
[`registry/lazy-validation.json`](../registry/lazy-validation.json), not from the
nominal element-count ratio.

### What this can and cannot say per family

Both counters are whole-walk totals, so there is no per-family cost signal to
read: "cost is independent of data volume" is measured for the oracle as a
whole. What *is* attributable per family is narrower — whether a ladder's
payload growth measurably ran through that family's structures — and the tool
derives that from report fields rather than from what a ladder is called:

| signal | attributed to |
|---|---|
| `chunk_index_refs >= 1` at every point | `chunk_index` |
| `chunk_index_refs == 0` at every point (a contiguous layout whose stored size grows) | `dataset_layout_filter_fill` |
| `decode_filters` non-empty at every point | `dataset_layout_filter_fill` |

The `chunks` control is excluded by construction: its metadata grows on
purpose, so it demonstrates counter sensitivity, not flat cost. The attribution
lands in `family_evidence` in the artifact, and `h5cve verification` renders
`lazy_validation_performance` as `met` for exactly those families and `partial`
for the rest. `partial` there is a ceiling, not a pending measurement — closing
it needs a payload-growing ladder per family, and families like
`validation_controls` and `address_space_bounds` have no data axis to grow at
all. `check_lazy_docs.py` cross-checks the two sides: a family cannot claim
`met` without an attributed ladder, and an attributed family cannot stay
`partial`.

## In-Process Seam Self-Check

Analysing through `h5policy_analyze` instead of the CLI is ~7x faster (the
pickles load once, not per file), but every analysis then shares interpreter
state. `h5policy_analyze`'s reset list is what keeps them independent, and a
leak there is worse than slowness: one hostile input could silently change every
verdict after it, and a fuzzer would report those corrupted verdicts as findings.

**`tools/h5policy-seamcheck` is the gate on any work that batches analyses.**

```sh
tools/h5policy-seamcheck --count 120        # default: forensic profile
tools/h5policy-seamcheck --profile legacy --count 60
```

Two checks, over adversarial mutants built with the fuzzer's own engine:

| check | asserts |
|---|---|
| **A** agreement | the seam's (decision, finding codes, feature flags) equals the CLI's, which is the shipped behaviour and therefore ground truth |
| **B** order | the same mutants in a *different* order give the same verdicts |

Both passes select the same profile by construction — a forensic CLI run against
a seam left on its `untrusted_strict` default produces a large and very
plausible-looking divergence that has nothing to do with state.

Its first production run found a real leak: `h5policy_heap_data_seg_size`
survived into the next analysis, and a larger value from an earlier file
silently disabled the bound three call sites check link-name offsets against.
Check **A** caught it; check **B** did not, because the leak saturates within a
few analyses and both orders then agree. Neither check subsumes the other.

## h5mutate Semantic Mutation Engine

`tools/h5mutate` applies **typed** mutations that each target one named invariant
in [`registry/validation-coverage.yml`](../registry/validation-coverage.yml), reseal
the enclosing checksums, and emit a recipe sidecar (parent hash, intended
invariant/finding, changed byte ranges, reseals).  Each mutant is
self-validating — `family --verify` asserts h5policy emits the intended finding.

```text
h5mutate list  [--seed FILE]
h5mutate apply  --seed FILE --recipe NAME --out FILE
h5mutate family --seed FILE --out-dir DIR [--verify] [--family NAME]
```

A **family** is a locator plus a recipe table. The locator turns a seed into the
context its recipes need and reports when the seed does not carry the structure
at all -- a plain dataset is not a continuation seed, which is a skip and not an
error -- and the recipes never parse the file, they edit fields the locator found
and reseal what it says encloses them. Adding a family costs its locator; the
recipes are then a few lines each.

Five families exist:

| family | records | recipes | mutations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `object_header_continuation` | 1 | 6 | target overlapping the source chunk at start/interior/end, zero-size, out-of-file, alias onto an already-decoded chunk |
| `heap_structures` | 1 | 4 | doubling-table width zero and non-power-of-two, declared heap size one and two bits under the first row |
| `v2_btree` | 4 | 9 | node size at 0xFFFFFFFF and at the leaf framing, record size zero, in-range wrong client id, chunk client swap, root address out of file, total record count at zero and ±1 |
| `free_space` | 1 | 6 | a section one byte over the header's declared maximum, class count over the client's, broken section-count identity, list address and size out of file, zero list size |
| `global_heap` | 2 | 6 | zero-length and under-sized free sentinels, sentinel stopping short, object size wrapping the aligner, collection size below the floor and past EOF |

`free_space` carries a coverage argument the others do not. h5py cannot reach
free-space managers **at all** — neither a plain open nor an object walk decodes
FSHD/FSSE — so `h5policy-fuzz`'s oracle cannot judge an FSM mutant, and a false
accept in that family is undetectable by the fuzzer by construction. A
self-validating typed recipe is the only generator here whose output can be
judged. Its headline recipe, `fsm_sect_size_over_max`, targets a relational
bound: a section size is only wrong *relative* to the header's `max_sect_size`,
which is what sizes the bin array the section gets filed into. Measured on the
generated mutant, the assert-enabled build stops at
`assert(bin < sinfo->nbins)` and the NDEBUG+ASan build reports a
heap-buffer-overflow READ of size 8 in `H5FS__sect_link_size`
(`H5FSsection.c:935`) — the frame
[`registry/cases/fsm-section-bin-range.yml`](../registry/cases/fsm-section-bin-range.yml)
records.

`global_heap` is the cheapest family in the engine — a collection carries no
checksum anywhere, so the reseal step is a no-op — and its locator carries the
one reachability condition in the tool: the collection must be **referenced**.
A global heap has no access path of its own; it is reached only through a heap
ID naming its address. `valid/attr_null_vlen_userblock.h5` proves why that
matters: its attribute is a NULL vlen element, its collection has zero
references, and all six recipes came back *accepted* under `untrusted-strict`
while the forensic profile — which sweeps orphan collections directly —
rejected them. Both answers are right for their profile, so no recipe can
promise one finding on that seed, and the locator skips it. Every other
GCOL-bearing seed has between 1 and 12 references.

Three FSHD fields are off limits to a recipe, and it is not visible in the
layout: `max_sect_size`, `max_sect_addr` and `serial_sect_count` each *derive* a
field width in the FSSE section list that follows, so editing one re-frames
every section record and the list stops decoding — the mutant would then be
rejected for the wrong reason and the recipe would be promising a finding it did
not cause.

`v2_btree` is the first family whose one locator serves several records. A BTHD
is signature-findable with a single trailing checksum — the same shape as
`FRHP` — but the structure is shared: the client id in the header selects
whether `dense_index`, `chunk_index` or `shared_messages_legacy` owns the tree,
while the geometry fields belong to `btree_heap_index`'s shared validator
whichever it is. Its locator **enumerates** headers instead of taking the first
match, which the `FRHP` locator gets away with and this one cannot:
`valid/sohm_btree.h5` carries a type-5 dense-link header before its type-7 SOHM
root, so a first-match locator would edit the dense-link tree while the sidecar
claimed a SOHM target — a recipe recording an intent it did not carry out.

Every locator reads the file's offset and length widths from the **real**
superblock, at the offsets that superblock **version** puts them. Two things go
wrong with the obvious `raw[9]`/`raw[10]`. A user block puts the superblock at
512 or beyond, where those bytes are user data — measured 0/0 on
`valid/userblock_latest.h5`, whose real widths are 8/8. And versions 0 and 1
carry four more version bytes first, putting the widths at +13/+14 rather than
+9/+10: **20 of the 64 seeds** in `tests/valid` are version 0, so that is the
common case rather than a legacy corner. Either mistake yields a zero width,
which silently collapses every derived field offset to the head of the
structure. The self-validating design caught that as a checksum
failure rather than a silent wrong-field edit, but no family could run on a
userblock seed until the widths were read properly.

The bar for counting a recipe is that it emits its intended finding on seeds
other than the one it was developed against: the heap recipes were verified on
four structurally different heaps (dense-link, dense-attribute, shared-message,
and shared-message huge-object), and the `v2_btree` recipes on all 13
BTHD-bearing seeds in `tests/valid`, spanning client ids 5, 8 and 10 — three
record layouts rather than three copies of one file. That is what a recipe has
over a committed fixture: one mutation where the corpus needs several base
files.

Two candidates have been rejected for failing that bar, and both reasons are
recorded in the tool and in the family's `fuzz_targets` block rather than
deleted. The second is worth reading as a result in its own right:
`bt2_total_nrec_zero` produced three different outcomes across seeds, and on
two of them the outcome was **accept** — a measured false accept in which a
dense index's total record count is never compared against the node graph.
Chasing the record's own unmeasured half then escalated it: the count sizes
libhdf5's link table while the real tree fills it, so **n+1 segfaults** and
**n-1 aborts on heap corruption** in every shipped tool, from files h5policy
accepts under all four profiles. See
[`registry/cases/v2-btree-total-nrec-unchecked-in-name-walker.yml`](../registry/cases/v2-btree-total-nrec-unchecked-in-name-walker.yml).

`run.sh` runs `family --verify` for all three families as pinned checks on
seeds other than their development ones — `v2_btree` on two seeds of different
client classes, since a single seed would leave the multi-family claim resting
on one record layout — and `h5cve variants` uses the engine to populate a case
bundle.  The structure-aware **reducer** (`h5cve minimize`) is the
remaining half of roadmap change #5.

Bundles live under `cases/<id>/` (git-ignored working scratch); `promote` is
what lands tracked artifacts in `h5policy/tests/` and `registry/`.  The exact-
build probe (`tools/h5policy-probe`, and `h5policy/tools/probe/`) runs a selected
libhdf5 build under an `LD_PRELOAD` activation interposer inside a sandbox and
reports whether rejection preceded any OS-observable activation; see
[`h5policy/tools/probe/README.md`](../h5policy/tools/probe/README.md).

Before handing off a case bundle, check its untracked contents for portable
provenance and prohibited identifiers:

```sh
python3 tools/check_hygiene.py --paths cases/<id>
```

The same checker also loads `h5policy-probe` and tests its `portable_asan()`
emitter, in both modes.  An AddressSanitizer summary names the source tree the
instrumented build was compiled from in every symbolized frame — a host path the
probe does not choose and cannot omit — so that emitter is the one place where
scanning the output after the fact would keep re-finding a leak nobody had
fixed.

## Marker Scanner

`h5markers` is a multithreaded file scanner for concrete on-disk markers used
by HDF5 and Onion files. It covers the published format specifications and
implementation-defined signatures used by the current HDF5 library. See
[MARKERS.md](MARKERS.md) for the complete list and its sources.

`h5markers` can be used to quickly identify the locations of these markers in large files, which can be useful for debugging, data recovery, or understanding file structure.

Build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

Usage:

```bash
# List all known markers
build/h5markers --list-markers

# Scan a file with the default thread count
build/h5markers path/to/file.h5

# Scan with an explicit thread count (-j is a synonym for --threads)
build/h5markers --threads 8 path/to/file.h5.onion
build/h5markers -j 8 path/to/file.h5.onion

# Restrict the scan (and listing) to one group of markers
build/h5markers --group HDF5 path/to/file.h5
build/h5markers --group Onion --list-markers path/to/file.h5.onion

# Show usage
build/h5markers --help
```

The scanner prints one line per detected marker with the marker name and its file offset in both
hexadecimal and decimal. Progress is reported on stderr when scanning in a terminal.

For example, scanning the sample file `examples/file.h5` in this repository produces the following output:

```text
HDF5_SIGNATURE  0x0000000000000000 (0)
OHDR            0x0000000000000030 (48)
OHDR            0x00000000000000C3 (195)
TREE            0x00000000000001DF (479)
```

## h5explain Interactive Explorer

`h5explain` starts GNU poke with the repository pickles loaded and installs a small command layer for incremental HDF5 byte-level exploration:

```sh
./tools/h5explain [OPTIONS] FILE [OFFSET]
./tools/h5explain --help
```

`OFFSET` may be decimal or hexadecimal, for example `48` or `0x30`. Without an offset, the tool starts at the HDF5 superblock.

Commands supplied with `-c`/`--command` or on a piped standard input run as a batch session that exits instead of entering the REPL:

```sh
printf 'root\nls\n' | ./tools/h5explain examples/file.h5

**Navigation commands:** `root`, `h5super`, `cd ("PATH")`, `go (OFF#B)`, `go (OFF#B, "PATH")`, `gos ("0xADDR")`, `gos ("0xADDR", "PATH")`, `back`, `pwd`

`cd` accepts a link name, a relative or absolute path, and `.`/`..` components.
`back` retraces a bounded multi-step history one location per call. Up to `256`
prior locations are retained; after that, the oldest is discarded. `go`/`gos`
refuse offsets at or past the end of the file.

Version 1 object headers have no signature, so `go`/`gos` infer them from the version and message count. When a kind was inferred rather than confirmed by a signature, `pwd` and `info` mark it `(inferred: no signature)`; reaching the same address through `root` or `cd` corroborates it and the marker disappears.

**Inspection commands:** `explain`, `explain (N)`, `explain_msg (N)`, `info`, `msgs`, `cur`, `ls` / `links`, `traverse`, `dump`, `h5dump`

**Policy commands:** `check`, `check_all`, `profile`, `profile ("NAME")`

`check` runs the h5policy oracle over the open file and reports the findings that bear on the cursor — matched by byte extent or by object path, since h5policy anchors findings both ways. When nothing bears on the cursor it distinguishes *reached*, *not reached*, *not recorded for this kind*, and *walk stopped early*, so silence is never mistaken for a clean bill of health. See [`h5explain/README.md`](../h5explain/README.md#policy-checks).

Use `msgs` to list object-header messages, then `explain (N)` or `explain_msg (N)` to explain message `N` in the current object header. Type `help` at the prompt for a full description of each command.

`traverse` is the only command that recursively walks chunk indexes. Ordinary navigation and `info` map the current primitive only, so large chunk indexes are not traversed accidentally.

`back` returns to the location before the most recent successful navigation
step (`go`, `gos`, `cd`, `root`, `h5super`). Repeated calls keep retracing until
the retained history is empty; a failed navigation that does not move the
cursor adds no history entry.
