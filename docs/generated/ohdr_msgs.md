# IV.A. Disk Format: Level 2A - Data Object Headers and Messages

<a id="subsec_fmt4_dataobject_hdr"></a>

Upstream: [HDF5 File Format Specification 4.0, section IV.A.1, IV.A.2, IV.A.3, IV.B, VII.A, VII.B](https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/_f_m_t4.html#subsec_fmt4_dataobject_hdr) · Coverage: **Partial**

Object headers store all metadata associated with an HDF5 data object
(a group or a dataset). Every object header is composed of a prefix
(`oh_hdr`) followed by a sequence of variable-length messages; the
messages describe the object's dataspace, datatype, storage layout,
attributes, and other properties.

Two object header versions are defined. Version 1 is the original
format and has no signature. Version 2 begins with the 4-byte signature
`'OHDR'` and is more compact: it narrows several fields, makes timestamps
and attribute phase-change thresholds optional, and adds a checksum over
the entire header. An object header may span more than one contiguous
block on disk; additional blocks are continuation chunks referenced by
Object Header Continuation messages (type 0x0010). Version 2 continuation
chunks begin with the 4-byte signature `'OCHK'`; version 1 continuation
chunks have no signature.

Each message occupies one slot in an object header chunk and is
preceded by a `msg_prefix`, whose layout differs between version 1 and
version 2 headers. The message payload begins immediately after the
prefix. Message type identifiers range from 0x0000 to 0x0018. The
`message_factory` function dispatches a raw type ID and file offset to
the appropriate typed struct. Unknown types are returned as bounded raw byte
arrays; callers decide whether the message flags permit skipping them.

Several messages exist in an "old" and a "new" versioned form:
`oh_msg_old_fill` / `oh_msg_fill` and `oh_msg_old_mtime` /
`oh_msg_mtime`. Applications should write only the new form; the old
form is retained for reading legacy files.

All fields are stored in little-endian byte order. The executable mappings
reject source-defined local invariants before a malformed field can drive a
later map: unsupported dataspace, link, layout, and index versions; reserved
flag bits; invalid scalar/null dataspace ranks; zero link names; zero-length
continuation chunks; and invalid chunk-index encodings. Once a superblock
has supplied its declared EOF, hard-link targets plus continuation and
metadata-cache-image address ranges are checked against that bound. Target
type validation and graph-wide consistency remain outside this
format-inspection layer.

## Data Object Header Prefix

Pickle type: `oh_hdr`.

An HDF5 object header in either version 1 or version 2 format. The first four bytes are mapped twice: once as `sig_peek` (pinned at offset 0 without consuming bytes) to select the correct union arm, and again as part of the chosen version struct.

**Layout: Version 1 Object Header Prefix**

<table class="format-layout">
  <thead><tr><th>byte</th><th>byte</th><th>byte</th><th>byte</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Version</td><td>Reserved</td><td colspan="2">Number of Messages</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="4">Reference Count</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="4">Object Header Size</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="4">Reserved</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Layout: Version 2 Object Header Prefix**

<table class="format-layout">
  <thead><tr><th>byte</th><th>byte</th><th>byte</th><th>byte</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td colspan="4">Signature</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Version</td><td>Flags</td><td colspan="2">Optional Fields</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="4">Optional Fields (continued)</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="4">Chunk 0 Size</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="4">Messages (variable size)</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="4">Checksum</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The signature is the four ASCII bytes `OHDR`. The flags select the optional timestamp, phase-change, and creation-order fields and the width of Chunk 0 Size.

**Fields: Data Object Header Prefix**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Sig Peek | `sig_peek` | Four bytes read at file offset 0 of the header without advancing the read position. If equal to the signature 'O' 'H' 'D' 'R' the version 2 arm is selected; otherwise the version 1 arm is selected. |

### Version 2

Pickle union arm: `v2`.

Version 2 object header layout (identified by the 4-byte signature 'O' 'H' 'D' 'R'). More compact than version 1; adds a checksum and optional timestamps.

**Fields: Version 2**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Signature | `signature` | 4-byte signature: 'O' 'H' 'D' 'R'. Must match `H5_FORMAT_OHDR_SIGNATURE`. |
| Version | `version` | Object header version number. Must be 2. |
| Flags | `flags` | Bit flags controlling optional fields and the encoding of `chunk0_size`. Bits 0–1: byte width of `chunk0_size`: 00 = 1 byte, 01 = 2 bytes, 10 = 4 bytes, 11 = 8 bytes. Bit 2: creation-order tracking is active — message prefixes include the optional `crt_order` field. Bit 3: a creation-order index (B-tree) is maintained for the attributes of this object. Bit 4: the `attr_phase` field is present. Bit 5: the `timestamps` field is present. |
| Timestamps | `timestamps` | Optional creation and access timestamps (type `hdr_timestamps`). Present when `flags` bit 5 is set. _optional_ |
| Attr Phase | `attr_phase` | Optional attribute phase-change thresholds (type `hdr_attr_phase`). Present when `flags` bit 4 is set. _optional_ |
| Chunk0 Size | `chunk0_size` | Size in bytes of the message data in the first object header chunk. Encoded as 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes according to `flags` bits 0–1. The message data immediately follows this field and is not itself part of the on-disk `oh_hdr` struct; it is accessed via the internal `_msg_chunk` wrapper. Any padding between the last message and the checksum is the trailing part of that same `chunk0_size`-byte region; `get_gap_size` derives its length instead of mapping a second on-disk field. |
| Chksum | `chksum` | 4-byte Jenkins lookup3 checksum computed over all bytes of the object header from `signature` through the complete `chunk0_size`-byte message-and-padding region. |

### Version 1

Pickle union arm: `v1`.

Version 1 object header layout. Identified by a version byte of 1 at the start of the header (no signature bytes precede it).

**Fields: Version 1**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Version | `version` | Object header version number. Must be 1. |
| Reserved | `res1` | Reserved. Must be zero. |
| Message Cnt | `msg_cnt` | Total number of header messages across all chunks of this object header, including any continuation chunks. |
| Object Ref Cnt | `obj_ref_cnt` | Reference count: the number of hard links pointing to this object. An object is eligible for deletion when this count reaches zero. |
| Object Header Size | `obj_hdr_size` | Size in bytes of the message data in the first object header chunk. The message bytes immediately follow the 16-byte fixed prefix and are accessed via the internal `_msg_chunk` wrapper. |
| Reserved | `res2` | Reserved. Must be zero (4 bytes). |


## Object Header Timestamps

Pickle type: `hdr_timestamps`.

Four UNIX timestamps optionally embedded in a version 2 object header. Present when bit 5 of the object header `flags` field is set. Each value is a 32-bit unsigned seconds count relative to the UNIX epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

**Fields: Object Header Timestamps**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Access | `access` | Time of the last read access to the object. |
| Modification | `modification` | Time of the last write to the object's raw data. |
| Change | `change` | Time of the last change to the object's metadata. |
| Birth | `birth` | Time at which the object was created. |


## Attribute Phase-change Thresholds

Pickle type: `hdr_attr_phase`.

Attribute storage phase-change thresholds optionally embedded in a version 2 object header. Present when bit 4 of `flags` is set. These thresholds control when the HDF5 library switches between compact attribute storage (inside the object header) and indexed attribute storage (in a fractal heap and B-tree).

**Fields: Attribute Phase-change Thresholds**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Max Compact | `max_compact` | Maximum number of attributes stored in compact form before the library converts to indexed storage. Once the count exceeds this value the library migrates to a fractal heap and B-tree. |
| Min Dense | `min_dense` | Minimum number of attributes that must remain in indexed storage before the library converts back to compact form. Must be less than or equal to `max_compact`. |


## Object Header Message Prefix

Pickle type: `msg_prefix`.

Fixed-size header that precedes every message payload in an object header chunk. The layout differs between version 1 and version 2 headers; the active arm is selected by the global version state set when the enclosing `oh_hdr` is mapped.

### Version 1 Message Prefix

Pickle union arm: `v1_msg_prefix`.

Version 1 message prefix (5 bytes of declared fields; the message-decoding logic accounts for 3 additional reserved bytes beyond this struct, giving an effective prefix size of 8 bytes).

**Fields: Version 1 Message Prefix**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Message Type | `msg_type` | 16-bit message type identifier. Values 0x0000–0x0018 are defined by the HDF5 specification; all others are reserved. |
| Message Size | `msg_size` | Size of the message payload in bytes, not including this prefix or the 3 reserved bytes that follow it. |
| Message Flags | `msg_flags` | Bit flags applying to this message. Bit 0: message data is constant after object creation and may be cached or shared. Bit 1: message is shared (payload is a Shared Message record rather than the message data itself). Bit 2: this message must not be shared. Bit 3: the HDF5 library may skip this message on open if it does not understand it. Bit 4: this message was marked as shareable but has not yet been moved to the shared message table. Bit 5: the object header was created before version 1.6 and this message was not originally encoded as a shared message. |

### Version 2 Message Prefix

Pickle union arm: `v2_msg_prefix`.

Version 2 message prefix (4 bytes without creation-order tracking, 6 bytes with it). The type field narrows from 16 to 8 bits compared with the version 1 prefix.

**Fields: Version 2 Message Prefix**

<a id="subsubsec_fmt4_dataobject_hdr_msg_dtmessage"></a>

## Datatype Message

Pickle type: `oh_msg_dtype`.

Datatype message (type 0x0003). Fully describes the type of a dataset's elements or an attribute's values. The datatype class is encoded in `hdr.flags` bits 0–3; the format version in bits 4–7. Compound, enumerated, variable-length, and array types embed one or more recursive `dtype_hdr` + properties blocks. Version 5 adds the recursive Complex class (11).

### Enumeration

Pickle union arm: `enumeration`.

Class 8. Mapping of integer values to symbolic names. The number of members is in `hdr.flags` class bits (bits 8–23). Embeds a recursive base-type descriptor followed by member names and values.

#### Version 3

Pickle union arm: `v3`.

Member names for version 3: array of plain NUL-terminated strings.

### Variable Length

Pickle union arm: `variable_length`.

Class 9. Variable-length sequence or string. The VL type (sequence vs. string) is in `hdr.flags` class bits. Embeds a recursive base-type descriptor.

**Fields: Variable Length**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Base Header | `base_hdr` | 8-byte `dtype_hdr` of the base element type. |

### Complex

Pickle union arm: `complex`.

Class 11, introduced with datatype message version 5. A homogeneous complex number contains two values of the recursive floating-point base type. Class bit 0 marks homogeneous encoding; bits 1–2 select rectangular (0), polar (1), or exponential (2) form. This arm decodes the only encoding the format defines — homogeneous, rectangular, reserved class bits clear — which is also the only one the library reads or writes.

**Fields: Complex**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Base Header | `base_hdr` | 8-byte `dtype_hdr` of the floating-point base type. |
| Base Props | `base_props` | Type-class properties for the floating-point base type. |

### Complex Undefined

Pickle union arm: `complex_undefined`.

Class 11 with any other class bit field: not homogeneous, a reserved form, or a reserved bit set. No property layout is defined for those encodings, so this arm maps nothing past the 8-byte header — it reports the class bits as found and leaves the property bytes raw rather than presenting a base type that no consumer would ever read. Its constraint is the exact complement of `complex`, so a defined complex that merely fails to map (a truncated one, say) still raises instead of decoding here.


## Datatype Message Header

Pickle type: `dtype_hdr`.

8-byte common header present at the start of every Datatype message and embedded recursively in compound, enumerated, variable-length, array, and complex types. Encodes the datatype class, format version, and class-specific flags.

## File Space Info Message

Pickle type: `oh_msg_fsinfo`.

File space info message (type 0x0017). Describes the file space management strategy. Deprecated version 0 uses the legacy strategy layout and optionally stores six manager addresses; version 1 uses the modern strategy layout and optionally stores twelve addresses split between small and large allocations. Stored in the superblock extension.

**Fields: File Space Info Message**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Version | `version` | Format version. Version 0 is deprecated and has a distinct legacy layout; version 1 is the current layout. |
| Strategy | `strategy` | Version-dependent file-space strategy. In v0: 0 = DEFAULT, 1 = ALL_PERSIST, 2 = ALL, 3 = AGGR_VFD, 4 = VFD. In v1: 0 = FSM_AGGR, 1 = PAGE, 2 = AGGR, 3 = NONE. |
| Persist | `persist` | Version 1 only. Non-zero if free-space-manager state is persisted across file opens. |
| Threshold | `threshold` | Minimum free-space section size (`sizeof_lengths` bytes) that is tracked. |
| Free-space Address | `fs_addr` | Version 0 only, present when strategy is ALL_PERSIST (1). Array of 6 file addresses (`sizeof_offsets` bytes each), one per legacy allocation type. |
| Page Size | `page_size` | Version 1 file-space page size (`sizeof_lengths` bytes). |
| Pgend Meta Thres | `pgend_meta_thres` | Version 1 threshold for storing small metadata at the end of a page. |
| Eoa | `eoa` | Version 1 end-of-address value from before free-space-manager allocation (`sizeof_offsets` bytes). |
| Small Free-space Address | `small_fs_addr` | Version 1 only, present when `persist` is non-zero. Array of 6 file addresses (`sizeof_offsets` bytes each) for small-allocation free-space managers, one per allocation type. |
| Large Free-space Address | `large_fs_addr` | Version 1 only, present when `persist` is non-zero. Array of 6 file addresses for large-allocation free-space managers, one per allocation type. |

## Metadata Cache Image Message

Pickle type: `oh_msg_mdci`.

Metadata cache image message (type 0x0018). Points to a serialized snapshot of the metadata cache written at file close to accelerate the next file open.

**Fields: Metadata Cache Image Message**

| Field | Pickle identifier | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Version | `version` | Format version. Must be 0. |
| Image Address Raw | `image_addr_raw` | File address of the serialized metadata cache image block. |
| Image Size | `image_size` | Byte size of the metadata cache image block (`sizeof_lengths` bytes). |
