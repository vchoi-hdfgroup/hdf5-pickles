# Assert-masked deserializer invariants

**Status: draft, work in progress.** This catalogs GitHub issue #87: places
where a value decoded from untrusted HDF5 file bytes is validated only by
`assert()` — or by ordinary `if (...) HGOTO_ERROR(...)` code wrapped in
`#ifndef NDEBUG` — rather than a real, always-on check. Both mechanisms
disappear identically under `-DNDEBUG`, i.e. in every shipped Release build,
so both count as "assert-masked" here.

Five of the issue's seven named areas are complete (SOHM, Extensible
arrays, V2 B-trees, Free-space managers, Metadata-cache images); the other
two (Dataset chunk records, Fractal heaps) are not yet started. This is a
first pass, not a final document.

## Scope

**In scope:** a check that exists in the source but is defeated by a build
flag (`assert()`, or a `#ifndef NDEBUG` block), validating a value that comes
from untrusted file bytes.

**Out of scope:** asserts on pure internal/programmer state unrelated to file
bytes (caller-supplied pointers, ref-counts, cache-state invariants); sites
where a newer, non-`assert` initialization helper already performs a real,
`NDEBUG`-surviving check; debug-only or test-only code paths not reachable
from an ordinary application opening an untrusted file.

**How findings were verified.** Every finding below claiming a *measured*
consequence was checked by building a real, byte-level fixture — one or two
bytes changed in a valid seed file, its Jenkins-lookup3 checksum resealed —
and then observing both `h5policy`'s verdict and a real libhdf5 build's
actual behavior (timing, memory, and, where useful, the full HDF5 error
stack via a minimal C reproducer). Findings not yet given this treatment are
marked "traced, not yet measured" rather than assumed either way.

**Abbreviations used throughout the tables below:** OOM (out-of-memory), DoS
(denial-of-service), ASan (AddressSanitizer, a compiler instrumentation that
crashes immediately at the point of an invalid memory access rather than
letting the corruption surface later or silently), RSS (resident set size —
a process's actual physical-memory usage), and the POSIX signals SIGSEGV
(invalid memory access), SIGABRT (abnormal-termination request, often from
an internal safety check firing), and SIGBUS (a fatal bus error, e.g. a
misaligned or unmapped access).

## SOHM (`H5SM*.c`, 170 asserts across 5 files — complete)

Every finding below has now been built as a real fixture (one or two bytes
changed in a valid seed, checksum resealed) and measured against both
`h5policy` and a real libhdf5 build — none are "traced only."

| # | Invariant | Root cause | Guard site(s) | Consequence | `h5policy` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Table format `version` | `H5Oshmesg.c:87` — raw decode, no check at the decode site itself | `H5SMcache.c:214` | **Measured: inert.** Opens and reads normally — only one version is ever defined and nothing branches on it | Confirmed: dedicated check (`H5_CORRUPT_SOHM_VERSION`) |
| 2 | `num_indexes` bounds | `H5Oshmesg.c:95` — raw decode, no check at the decode site itself | `H5SMcache.c:222`, `H5SM.c:1960` | **Measured: clean file-open failure** — an inflated count sizes the expected master-table read past the file's real end-of-allocation (`addr overflow`), no crash, no memory growth | Confirmed: dedicated check (`H5_CORRUPT_SOHM_INDEX_COUNT`, valid range 1-8) |
| 3 | Message `location` legality | `H5SMmessage.c:312` — raw decode, no check at the decode site itself; only two legal encoded values exist, and a third is never rejected anywhere in the subsystem either | `H5SMmessage.c:227,320`, `H5SM.c:1178,1310,2196,2371`, `H5SMbtree2.c:181` | **Measured: reads unaffected; a write fails.** An illegal value falls into the wrong branch, reinterpreting an in-heap record's bytes as an in-object-header record — genuine type confusion, caught cleanly by an address-vs-end-of-allocation bound | Confirmed: dedicated check (`H5_CORRUPT_SOHM_LOCATION`) |
| 4 | Index `index_type` legality | `H5SMcache.c:247` — raw decode, no check at the decode site itself | `H5SM.c:571,1322,1462,1810,2181,2700` (each silently treats an illegal 3rd value as `BTREE`) | **Measured: reads unaffected; a write fails.** The illegal value falls into the B-tree branch, which then tries to open a *list* structure's address as a v2 B-tree header — genuine type confusion, caught cleanly by a checksum mismatch | Confirmed: dedicated check (`H5_CORRUPT_SOHM_INDEX_TYPE`) |
| 5 | `list_max`/`btree_min` cross-index consistency | `H5SM.c:1984-1985` — decoded independently per index, no cross-check | `H5SM.c:1984-1985` | **Measured: silent misreporting, no functional break.** Built a genuine 2-index file, patched only one index's values (unreachable via any legitimate API call). `H5Fget_create_plist()` silently reports the *other* index's values — the real list↔B-tree conversion logic is unaffected since it reads each index's own values directly | **None — confirmed coverage gap.** `h5policy` accepts the crafted file outright |
| 6 | `msg_type_id` out-of-bounds array index | `H5SMmessage.c:323` — raw decode, indexes a fixed 27-element array with no bound check before the access | `H5SM.c:2343-2344`, `H5Omessage.c:1091` | **Measured, cross-platform (macOS + Linux, stock and ASan builds): the out-of-bounds read genuinely executes on a real, crafted file, and is silent on every build tested** — not because the access is safe, but because (a) ASan's redzones don't cover "wild" far-out-of-bounds reads on small globals, a general sanitizer limitation, not platform-specific, and (b) the one reachable consumer path uses the resulting garbage value only in a pointer-*equality* comparison, never a dereference | Confirmed: dedicated check (`H5_CORRUPT_SOHM_MESSAGE_TYPES`) |

**Also checked, not a vulnerability:** the *within*-index
relationship `num_messages > list_max` (a single index whose message count
already exceeds its own declared capacity) is already properly guarded — a
real, deliberate check in `H5SM__cache_list_verify_chksum`
(`H5SMcache.c:495-496`, `"number of SOHM messages exceeds list size"`), not
masked by anything.

**Note on `h5policy` coverage generally:** five of these six invariants
have a dedicated check, all defined in `h5policy/pickles/h5_sohm.pk` (see
the table for each one's specific code). The sixth, `list_max`/`btree_min`
cross-index divergence (finding #5 above), is a genuine gap: `h5policy`
has no check for it at all and accepts the crafted file outright.

**Recommendation for finding #5 (not implemented here):** unlike the other
five, closing this one needs two separate fixes, not one. On the libhdf5
side, the assert at `H5SM.c:1984-1985` could be promoted to a real,
always-on check that rejects the file at open time when any two indexes'
`list_max`/`btree_min` diverge — safe to do unconditionally, since no
legitimate writer can ever produce a divergent file in the first place. On
the `h5policy` side, that promotion alone would not add coverage: there is
no existing check to strengthen, so closing the gap needs a genuinely new
check in `h5policy/pickles/h5_sohm.pk` for this same cross-index
relationship. Both are deliberately left as recommendations rather than
changes in this PR — worth a maintainer decision on priority and exact
shape before anyone implements them.

## Extensible arrays (`H5EA*.c`, 314 asserts across 11 files — complete)

Two independent, fully-measured severe findings — finding #1 in the table
below (header `nsblks` underflow), and `max_idx_set`, covered separately
under **Adjacent findings** since it isn't literally assert-masked;
everything else across all 11 files reconciles to internal/write-path
checks or an echo of one of these two.

All six `H5EA_create_t` header parameters share one root cause
(`H5EAcache.c:320-328` — raw decode, no check at the decode site itself;
real validation exists only in `H5EA__hdr_create`, `H5EAhdr.c:346-388`,
masked by `#ifndef NDEBUG` and create-path-only in any case), so the table
below lists each field's own measured consequence rather than repeating the
shared root cause for rows 1-5; rows 6-7 are two further candidates found
one level deeper in the call graph, each with its own root-cause site:

| # | Invariant | Root cause | Guard site(s) | Consequence | `h5policy` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `max_nelmts_bits` + `data_blk_min_elmts` (→ `hdr->nsblks`) | `H5EAcache.c:320-328` (shared, see above) | `H5EAhdr.c:180-182` (weak, nonzero-only) | **Measured: severe OOM DoS** — 1 byte changed, 55GB+ RAM, OOM-killed after 22s, ordinary dataset read | Confirmed: dedicated geometry check rejects instantly |
| 2 | `max_dblk_page_nelmts_bits` (→ `dblk_page_nelmts` via `1 << max_dblk_page_nelmts_bits`) | same | `H5EAcache.c:1011,1014,1018,1423` (react after the fact) | Measured: data-loss-on-read (checksum mismatch, no crash) | Confirmed, same check |
| 3 | `sup_blk_min_data_ptrs` | same | — | Measured: data-loss-on-read (checksum mismatch); a cross-field variant (`nsblk_addrs`, computed unguarded at `H5EAiblock.c:113-115` — see row 7) caught by a 3rd, distinct incidental mechanism — see below | Confirmed, same check |
| 4 | `raw_elmt_size` | same | — | Measured: data-loss-on-read (checksum mismatch) | Confirmed, same check |
| 5 | `idx_blk_elmts` | same | — | Measured: data-loss-on-read — checksum mismatch at `0`; addr-overflow at a value that actually violates page capacity | Confirmed directly for a violating value |
| 6 | `H5EA__hdr_alloc_elmts`'s `idx` underflow (one level deeper) | `H5EAhdr.c:245` — no check at this computation site | `H5EAhdr.c:316-317` (sibling `free_elmts` asserts on the same `idx`, elsewhere) | Measured: subsumed by #2's condition, not an independent hazard | n/a — same check already catches the precondition |
| 7 | `H5EA__iblock_alloc`'s `nsblk_addrs` underflow (cross-field, one level deeper) | `H5EAiblock.c:113-115` — zero guard | — | Measured: caught by a 3rd incidental mechanism (`H5C__load_entry` generic length-sanity bound), ~18-exabyte wrap, ~3.5MB peak memory, not independent | Confirmed: dedicated check also covers this relationship |

### Finding #1 in depth — header `nsblks` underflow: severe OOM DoS

`H5EA__hdr_init` (`H5EAhdr.c:185`) computes:

```c
hdr->nsblks = 1 + (hdr->cparam.max_nelmts_bits - H5VM_log2_of2(hdr->cparam.data_blk_min_elmts));
```

If `max_nelmts_bits < log2(data_blk_min_elmts)`, this underflows in unsigned
32-bit arithmetic to a value near 2^32, sizing an `H5FL_SEQ_MALLOC` followed
by a loop that writes every slot.

**Measured:** one byte changed in a 2208-byte valid seed file
(`max_nelmts_bits` 32→1). `h5policy --profile untrusted-strict` rejects it
instantly, zero memory (`H5_CORRUPT_EXTENSIBLE_ARRAY_GEOMETRY`, a
deliberate, comprehensive geometry check covering all six fields and their
cross-relationships). A real build (h5py 3.14.0 / HDF5 1.14.6, arm64 macOS)
opens the file fine, then an *ordinary* `dataset[...]` read causes:

```
maximum resident set size: 5,447,286,784 bytes   (~5.4 GB)
peak memory footprint:    55,473,675,312 bytes   (~55.5 GB)
real time: 22.37s before the process was killed
```

A ~2KB file, one byte changed, no special API calls — just opening a file
and reading a dataset the ordinary way.

**Why #1 alone is severe while #2-#7 are not (the generalized rule, tested
across all seven rows above):** a field's bad value produces a severe
consequence only if its arithmetic stays entirely inside the header's own
already-checksummed structure, as `nsblks` does. Every other row's
corruption instead changes the computed size (or requested read length) of
a *different* metadata block — the index block, in every case tested — and
that block's own independent verification (a checksum, an
address/size-vs-end-of-allocation bound, or the generic cache-load
length-sanity bound behind row #7) catches the mismatch before the bad
arithmetic ever gets a chance to misbehave for real. These are at least
three distinct, independently-confirmed incidental mechanisms, not one, and
none of them is a deliberate defense against this specific bug class —
`h5policy`'s own dedicated geometry check is the only *deliberate* one at
play here.

A separate, non-assert-masked finding (`max_idx_set`) was also found in this
area during the same sweep — see **Adjacent findings**, below.

## V2 B-trees (`H5B2*.c`, 344 asserts across 9 files — complete)

Three findings, all independently measured against a real fixture: two are
genuine `h5policy` coverage gaps (`merge_percent` thrashing; the by-index
descent pin leak), one is a real, bounded hazard that turns out to already
be covered (`node_size`). A fourth, differently-shaped finding —
`node_nrec` feeding a checksum-length computation with no bound against the
real buffer size — is covered separately under **Adjacent findings**,
below, since (like Extensible Arrays' `max_idx_set`) it is not literally
assert-masked: nothing guards it at all, not even an assert. Five of the
nine files (`H5B2internal.c`, `H5B2int.c`, `H5B2dbg.c`, `H5B2test.c`,
`H5B2stat.c`) reconcile entirely to write-path bookkeeping, debug-tool-only,
or test-only code, and contribute nothing.

`node_size` and `merge_percent`/`split_percent` share one root cause:
`H5B2__hdr_init` (`H5B2hdr.c:107-116`) asserts several properties of its
`cparam` argument — this function runs both at B-tree-creation time
(trusted caller) and directly from the deserialize path
(`H5B2cache.c:288`, right after `cparam.node_size`, `cparam.split_percent`
and `cparam.merge_percent` are decoded raw at `H5B2cache.c:261,270-271`
with no check at the decode site itself) — so its argument asserts are
genuine deserializer invariants, not just internal contracts.

| # | Invariant | Root cause | Guard site(s) | Consequence | `h5policy` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `node_size` sanity | `H5B2cache.c:261` (shared, see above) | `H5B2hdr.c:112` (`assert(cparam->node_size > 0)`) | **Measured: real, bounded resource spike.** Patched to the field's own on-disk maximum (`0xFFFFFFFF`, a fixed 4-byte field). `H5B2__hdr_init` eagerly `malloc`s and `memset`s a `node_size`-sized scratch buffer *before any node is ever read* — ~898MB peak RSS, ~1.1s delay opening a 15KB file, no crash. Caught afterward, incidentally, by an unrelated addr-vs-end-of-allocation check when the same corrupted value is later used as a leaf's read length | Confirmed: dedicated check (`H5_CORRUPT_V2_BTREE_NODE_SIZE`, `node_size > file_size`) — not a gap |
| 2 | `merge_percent < split_percent / 2` | `H5B2cache.c:270-271` (shared, see above) | `H5B2hdr.c:116` | **Measured: real tree-shape pathology, write-path only.** Violating the safety margin (`merge_percent=50` against `split_percent=100`) made both children of a fresh split land exactly on the corrupted merge threshold; the very next ordinary delete triggered a premature merge, collapsing a two-child, 46-record split straight back into one 45-record leaf. Every record stayed correctly tracked throughout — no data loss, no wrong content — just needless, repeated split-then-remerge churn on ordinary write traffic near the threshold | **None — confirmed coverage gap.** No pickle validates the header's own `split_percent`/`merge_percent` bytes at all (a same-named pair of fields elsewhere, in an unrelated message type, is checked, but not these) |
| 3 | Internal node's per-child `all_nrec` consistency (by-index descent) | `H5B2cache.c:672-678` — `node_ptrs[].all_nrec` decoded raw, no check at the decode site itself | `H5B2.c:826` (`assert(0 && "Index off end of tree??")`) — the only thing standing between a corrupted per-child count and a broken descent | **Measured: metadata-cache resource leak, not a crash.** The internal node's `H5AC_unprotect` call is only reached in the sibling branch, so a masked failure here leaves it permanently protected; the stale, un-advanced node pointer gets reprocessed at the wrong depth, eventually failing a checksum check against what should be a leaf. On `H5Fclose`, the leaked pin makes `H5C__flush_invalidate_ring` report `"Pinned entry count not decreasing"`, followed by the library's own `"infinite loop closing library"` diagnostic — a real, malformed-shutdown malfunction, not a true hang | **None — confirmed coverage gap.** Accepts the crafted file outright |

**Recommendation for finding 2, `merge_percent` (not implemented here):**
the same two-fix shape as SOHM's finding #5. On the libhdf5 side, the three
asserts on `cparam->split_percent`/`cparam->merge_percent`
(`H5B2hdr.c:114-116`) could be promoted to a real, always-on check at
header-deserialize time — safe to do unconditionally, since no legitimate
writer can ever produce a file violating these relationships (every real
client class hardcodes valid percentages at creation time). On the
`h5policy` side, that promotion alone adds nothing: there is no existing
check on the header's own `split_percent`/`merge_percent` bytes to
strengthen, so closing the gap needs a genuinely new check in
`h5policy/pickles/h5_btree2.pk` for these two fields and their
cross-relationship. Both left as recommendations, not changes, in this PR.

**Recommendation for finding 3, the index-off-end pin leak (not
implemented here):** on the libhdf5 side, the assert at `H5B2.c:826` could
become a real, always-on error — but the fix isn't just swapping `assert`
for `HGOTO_ERROR`: the branch would also need to release the
currently-protected internal node before returning, exactly as its sibling
branch already does, or the resource leak persists even with a clean error
path. On the `h5policy` side, `h5_btree2.pk` already has a related check
(`H5_CORRUPT_V2_BTREE_SUBTREE_COUNT`) — but it only catches a *local*
inconsistency, one child pointer's `all_nrec` being less than its own
`node_nrec` (confirmed by reading the check itself: `child_total <
child_nrec`, which our fixture's corruption — `all_nrec` reduced to 100
against a `node_nrec` of 12 — never triggers, since 100 is still greater
than 12). It does not check the *cross-sibling* sum this bug actually
depends on: whether a node's `node_ptrs[]` entries, taken together, sum to
what the level above expects. Closing this gap needs extending that
existing validation to the cross-sibling sum, not writing one from scratch.
Left as a recommendation, not a change, in this PR.

**Also checked, not a vulnerability:** `H5B2hdr.c:165`
(`assert(hdr->max_nrec_size <= H5B2_SIZEOF_RECORDS_PER_NODE)`) looked like a
candidate for the same shape of bug as row 3 — a silently-truncated width
misaligning every subsequent record decode — but tracing where
`max_nrec_size` is actually consumed shows the downcast that follows it
(`uint8_t`, range 0-255) has far more headroom than any real `node_size`
could ever need (at most 8 bytes, since `hsize_t` is 64-bit), and the value
is computed and used consistently on both the write and read side wherever
it appears. Skipping this assert most likely just lets an unusually large
node use a wider, still-correct encoding instead of tripping a
"bigger-than-expected" sanity check — reasoned through, not independently
fixture-tested, but not pursued further as a result.

**Also checked, and likewise not pursued:** `H5B2hdr.c:172`
(`assert(hdr->node_info[u].max_nrec <= hdr->node_info[u - 1].max_nrec)`),
checking that a deeper level's internal-node capacity never exceeds a
shallower level's. This one is closer to a proof than a search. A level's
capacity, `H5B2_NUM_INT_REC(h, d)` (`H5B2pkg.h:109-111`), is `node_size`
divided by a per-slot cost that includes `node_info[d-1].cum_max_nrec_size`
— the byte-width needed to encode the *cumulative* record count one level
down. That cumulative count is defined recursively,
`cum_max_nrec[d] = (max_nrec[d] + 1) * cum_max_nrec[d-1] + max_nrec[d]`,
which can only equal or exceed the level below it, never fall short — so
the byte-width needed to encode it, the per-slot cost, and therefore
capacity itself (a fixed `node_size` divided by a non-decreasing cost) are
all forced to move monotonically the right way, for any legal
`node_size`/`rrec_size`. Checked directly against the real numbers measured
on `dense_links_deep.h5` earlier in this document (`45`/`24`/`22` across
depths 0-2): the formula reproduces those exactly. What wasn't chased:
unlike the `max_nrec_size` item above, this conclusion rests on the
*triggering condition* being unreachable, not on tracing what would happen
downstream if it somehow were — a different, and here untested, kind of
"safe."

**Related, still-live hazard in this area — not this session's discovery,
partially re-verified where noted.** `H5G__obj_get_linfo` sizes a group's
in-memory link table directly from the v2 B-tree header's own declared
`total_nrec` (`hdr->root.all_nrec`, via `H5B2_get_nrec()`, no validation),
then `H5G__dense_build_table` fills that table by walking the tree for
real — a completely independent count. The two are supposed to always
agree, and only one direction of their disagreeing is actually guarded:

- **`total_nrec` understated** (declares `n-1`, tree really holds `n`): the
  table is allocated one slot short. `H5G__dense_build_table_cb`'s array
  write — `ltable->lnks[udata->curr_lnk]` — would run one slot past the
  allocation on the tree's last real record. The *only* thing standing in
  the way is `assert(udata->curr_lnk < udata->ltable->nlinks)`
  (`H5Gdense.c:716`) — masked under `-DNDEBUG`, at which point the
  out-of-bounds write happens for real, later surfacing as a `SIGABRT`
  (glibc's heap-corruption detector, on some later allocation).
- **`total_nrec` overstated** (`n+1` instead of `n`): the table gets one
  extra slot the walk never reaches, left at its zero-initialized `NULL`
  name. This direction has **no guard at all, not even this assert** — the
  crash happens later and elsewhere, when the table's own sort comparator
  (`H5G__link_cmp_name_inc`) dereferences that `NULL`, causing `SIGSEGV`.

Two of the three claims above are independently confirmed this session by
direct inspection; one is cited from prior work, not reproduced:

- **Confirmed by direct source read:** the guard is still exactly
  `assert(udata->curr_lnk < udata->ltable->nlinks)` at this exact commit
  (`4ee8adc29cd`) — the same one this whole catalog is measured against.
  Not fixed in libhdf5 itself, in either direction.
- **Confirmed by a live re-test:** `h5policy`, as it stands in the tree
  today, rejects a `total_nrec` off by `+1`, `-1`, or set to `0` — all three
  tested directly this session.
- **Not reproduced this session** — cited from
  `registry/cases/v2-btree-total-nrec-unchecked-in-name-walker.yml`: the
  actual crash behavior against a real, running libhdf5 build (the
  `SIGSEGV`/`SIGABRT` pair described above). That measurement predates this
  session; see the case file for its full history.

Net: a real, currently-live hazard in this exact area, on this exact
commit — closed on the `h5policy` side, still open in libhdf5 itself.

**Not chased further this session:** a companion assert on the same
by-index descent path, `H5B2.c:848` (`assert(idx < leaf->nrec)`, with a
write-side twin at `H5B2leaf.c:866`) — the final bound check once descent
reaches a leaf, rather than the internal-node "off end" check in row 3
above. Reaching it (rather than row 3's failure mode) would need a more
surgical corruption that stays checksum-valid at every level while still
landing a leaf with a too-large `idx` — real effort for what traces to a
likely lower ceiling (an in-bounds but garbage native-record read, not an
out-of-bounds one) than row 3's confirmed resource leak. Identified, not
fixture-tested.

## Free-space managers (`H5FS*.c`, 348 asserts across 7 files — complete)

Four findings, all independently measured against a real fixture: two are
genuine `h5policy` coverage gaps (`tot_sect_count`, understated direction;
`tot_space`), two are real, severe hazards that turn out to already be
covered — `node_count` (newly discovered this session) and `sect_size`
(pre-existing, discovered in a prior session). A fifth, differently-shaped
finding — `max_sect_addr` driving an unbounded per-section address width — is
covered separately under **Adjacent findings**, below, since (like
Extensible Arrays' `max_idx_set` and V2 B-trees' `node_nrec`) it is not
literally assert-masked: nothing guards it at all, not even an assert. Five
of the seven files (`H5FS.c`, `H5FSdbg.c`, `H5FSint.c`, `H5FStest.c`,
`H5FSstat.c`) reconcile entirely to lifecycle/API-contract bookkeeping,
debug-tool-only, or test-only code, and contribute nothing; the two that do
are `H5FScache.c` (the deserialize callbacks) and `H5FSsection.c` (the
in-memory section-info machinery `H5FS__sinfo_new` derives its per-section
address width from).

`tot_sect_count`, `serial_sect_count`, `ghost_sect_count`, and `tot_space`
are decoded together, with no validation at the decode site, in
`H5FS__cache_hdr_deserialize` (`H5FScache.c:258-265`).
`H5FS__cache_sinfo_deserialize` (`H5FScache.c:967-1051`) rebuilds all four by
walking the real section list, then only *checks* the header's original
claim against five back-to-back asserts (`H5FScache.c:1045-1050`) — every
one of which vanishes under `-DNDEBUG`.

| # | Invariant | Root cause | Guard site(s) | Consequence | `h5policy` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Overstated (3→10): `h5policy` already catches this direction (see next column), but if it didn't, the same corrupted value would reach real applications first — `H5Fget_free_sections()`'s returned count (from `H5FS_sect_stats`, a bare accessor read *before* the correcting walk) decouples from how many entries it actually fills, observed as 7 zero-valued phantom sections via `h5stat -s`'s `calloc`-based buffer (a `malloc`-based caller would see stale heap contents instead) | **Understated: confirmed gap, accepts outright.** Overstated: **not a gap** — `h5policy_walk_fspace_sections` (`h5_messages.pk:1128`, `while (seen < serial_sect)`) also drives its own walk length from the header's declared count, but a *higher* declared count than the list actually holds runs the loop past the real records and trips `H5_CORRUPT_FSM_SECTION_OVERRUN` before it can finish — asymmetric coverage, not by design |

A single corrupted header field (12480 → 99999999) made `h5stat`'s summary report 100002348 bytes free, 301066.8% of the file's own size, with zero error or warning | **Confirmed gap.** `h5policy_walk_fspace_manager` (`h5_messages.pk:1215-1334`) never even decodes `tot_space` — no variable, no check exists to strengthen |

| 4 | `sect_size` (a section's own serialized size) | `H5FScache.c:998-1000` (`UINT64DECODE_VAR`, no check) | `H5FScache.c:1000` (`assert(sect_size)`) — nonzero only | Pre-existing, not newly discovered this session — see `registry/cases/fsm-section-bin-range.yml`. Re-verified this session: the consumer-side hazard (`H5FS__sinfo_new`'s `sinfo->nbins = H5VM_log2_gen(fspace->max_sect_size)` sizing an array later indexed by `H5VM_log2_gen(sect->size)` with no bound, `H5FSsection.c:764,934`) is unchanged at this commit | **Not a gap.** `h5policy_walk_fspace_sections` (`h5_messages.pk:1159-1162`) has a dedicated relational check, `H5_CORRUPT_FSM_SECTION_SIZE_OVER_MAX` |

**Recommendation for finding 1, `tot_sect_count` understated (not
implemented here):** `h5policy_walk_fspace_sections`
(`h5_messages.pk:1064-1209`) drives its own walk length from the header's
declared `serial_sect` the same way libhdf5 does, and never checks
afterward that the walk actually reached the section list's checksum
boundary (`limit`, computed at line 1126). Closing the gap needs one added
check after the `while (seen < serial_sect)` loop: if `cur != limit`, the
section list contains more real, well-formed section records than the
header declared, and should be rejected the same way an *overstated* count
already is. This alone would also make the overstated/understated coverage
symmetric.

**Recommendation for finding 2, `tot_space` (not implemented here):** needs
a new check in `h5policy_walk_fspace_manager`/`h5policy_walk_fspace_sections`
(`h5_messages.pk`): decode the header's `tot_space` field (at
`hdr_addr#B + 6#B`, currently never extracted) and compare it against the
sum of each real section's `sect_size` accumulated during the walk,
rejecting a mismatch the same way libhdf5's own (masked) assert intends to,
but as a real, always-on check.

**Also checked, confirmed inert:** `ghost_sect_count`, the fourth field in
the same header cluster, decoded with equally zero validation. Patched 0→5
(leaving `tot_sect_count`/`serial_sect_count` and the real section list
untouched): `h5policy` rejects it via a different, already-existing
cross-field check (`H5_CORRUPT_FSM_SECTION_COUNT`,
`serial_sect + ghost_sect != tot_sect`, tripped even without touching the
other two fields), and the real build's `h5stat` output (default and `-s`)
was byte-for-byte identical to the valid seed's. Unlike its three siblings,
`ghost_sect_count` drives no loop-control condition and backs no
public-facing accessor — genuinely inert, not a finding.

## Metadata-cache images (`H5AC*.c`, `H5Cimage.c`, `H5Ocache_image.c`, 532 asserts across 6 files — complete)

Zero assert-masked findings in this area — a first for this catalog.
`H5AC.c` (116 asserts) is pure lifecycle/wrapper code around the generic
cache layer, with real, always-on checks (not asserts) guarding the one
application-supplied config struct it validates. `H5ACdbg.c` (16 asserts)
is debug-tool-only, most of its functions gated by `#ifndef NDEBUG` and not
even compiled into a release build. `H5ACmpio.c` (134 asserts) is entirely
wrapped in a single `#ifdef H5_HAVE_PARALLEL` from its first line to its
last — the whole file compiles to nothing outside an MPI-parallel build,
unreachable from an ordinary single-process open of an untrusted file.
`H5ACproxy_entry.c` (28 asserts) defines a pure in-memory placeholder
object — its own class registration sets `deserialize`/`verify_chksum`/
`get_initial_load_size` all to `NULL`, since it never touches disk.
`H5Ocache_image.c` (15 asserts) is the actual decode site for the cache
image's `addr`/`size` fields (reached from `H5Fsuper.c`; added to this
area's scope mid-sweep since it isn't named `H5AC*`) — its real
hazard-relevant checks turned out to be genuine, always-on `HGOTO_ERROR`s
(overflow and EOA-range checks), not masked asserts.

`H5Cimage.c` (223 asserts) holds the one real result from this area — but
it isn't assert-masked either, so it's written up under **Adjacent
findings**, below, rather than tabulated here: a deliberate design choice,
stated in the source's own comments, to skip checksum verification
entirely for metadata delivered via a cache image.

**Scope notes:** `H5Ocache_image.c` and the prefetched-entry-specific
portions of `H5Centry.c` (the consumer of the Adjacent finding below) were
added to this area's scope mid-sweep — both are genuinely part of the
cache-image feature's implementation, just not named `H5AC*`.
`H5Centry.c` in full (4,239 lines, mostly generic entry-lifecycle code
shared by every cache client in the library) was not swept — only its two
prefetched-entry-specific functions were read, the same exclusion applied
to `H5C.c` in every prior area.

## Adjacent findings (not literally assert-masked, same danger shape)

### Extensible arrays — `max_idx_set` — unbounded loop, reachable via a public API, zero `h5policy` coverage

`hdr->stats.stored.max_idx_set` ("highest element index stored, +1") is one
of six *array-statistics* fields in the extensible-array header (a
different family from the six create-time `cparam` fields above) — decoded
raw at `H5EAcache.c:336` with zero validation. Unlike the findings above,
there is no assert or `#ifndef NDEBUG` block guarding it anywhere; it was
simply never checked, on any path, in any build configuration. It directly
bounds a loop with no upper sanity check:

```c
/* H5EA.c:985, H5EA_iterate() */
for (u = 0; u < ea->hdr->stats.stored.max_idx_set && ret_value == H5_ITER_CONT; u++) {
    H5EA_get(ea, u, elmt);
    (*op)(u, elmt, udata);
}
```

This is reachable via an ordinary, documented **public API** —
`H5Dchunk_iter()`, the chunk-introspection call used by h5repack and any
application enumerating a dataset's chunks — backed by
`H5D__earray_idx_iterate` (`H5Dearray.c:1370`), guarded only by
`max_idx_set > 0`.

**Measured:** one 8-byte field changed in a 300-chunk fixture, checksum
resealed. With `max_idx_set = 50,000,000` (bounded, for a clean
measurement), a minimal C reproducer calling `H5Dchunk_iter`:

```
count=300 (all real chunks correctly reported)
1.22s real, ~41 million iterations/second
peak memory footprint: ~5.8MB (flat -- no growth)
```

Pure CPU-time cost, linear in the field's value. Since it's a full 64-bit
field with no ceiling, this scales to an arbitrarily long hang — confirmed
directly with `max_idx_set = 2^35` (~3.4×10^10), which left the same
reproducer pinned at 100% CPU / ~4MB RSS for 1:45 with zero completion
before being stopped. No crash, no memory blowup — the cost is purely the
raw iteration count, since each out-of-range lookup bails out cheaply via an
address-undefined check.

**`h5policy` coverage: none.** `h5policy --profile untrusted-strict`
returns `"decision": "accept", "findings": []` outright on the crafted
file. Unlike every one of the six `cparam` fields above — which `h5policy`
already covers via its own deliberate geometry check — this is a genuine,
currently-undetected gap in this repo's own tooling, not just a masked
libhdf5 check. Traced the other five array-statistics fields
(`nsuper_blks`, `super_blk_size`, `ndata_blks`, `data_blk_size`, `nelmts`)
for comparable hazards: all five are equally unvalidated, but only reached
via write-path increments, debug-dump printing, or one plain addition
reported as a storage-size number — none feeds a loop bound, allocation
size, or array index, so none appears to share this specific hazard.

**Recommendation (not implemented here):** a follow-up `h5policy` check —
something like rejecting a `max_idx_set` that is wildly disproportionate to
what the array's own geometry (`max_nelmts_bits`, `data_blk_min_elmts`,
etc.) could plausibly have populated. This would be a new check in
`h5policy/pickles/h5_chunkindex.pk`, touching tracked repository files, and
is deliberately left as a recommendation rather than a change in this PR —
worth a maintainer decision on priority and exact shape before anyone
implements it.

**Not chased further this session:** whether a single very large targeted
index (rather than iterating up to it) can push `H5EA__dblock_sblk_idx`'s
`sblk_idx` (grows as `log2(idx)`) past `hdr->nsblks`, causing an actual
out-of-bounds heap *read* into `hdr->sblk_info[]` — a structurally
different, and potentially more serious, class of bug than the
CPU-exhaustion DoS above (a memory-safety issue rather than resource
exhaustion), *if* reachable. A bounded iteration test never reached that
threshold; a follow-up attempt via `H5Dget_chunk_info_by_coord()` to query
one index directly itself stalled unexpectedly for 30s+, likely a
different mechanism, not pursued further.

### V2 B-trees — `node_nrec` — checksum-length computation with no bound against the real buffer, already caught by `h5policy`

A node's own record count, `node_nrec`, is decoded raw with no validation
at all — at the header level (`H5B2cache.c:275`, the root's own count) and
at the internal-node level (`H5B2cache.c:672-673`, each child pointer's own
count). Unlike the findings in the V2 B-trees table above, there is no
assert anywhere in this path; it is simply unchecked, on any path, in any
build configuration. That count then sizes the **checksum computation**
that gates loading the *next* node down — not the actual allocated buffer:

```c
/* H5B2cache.c:970 (leaf) / :569-570 (internal) */
chk_size = H5B2_LEAF_PREFIX_SIZE + (udata->nrec * udata->hdr->rrec_size);
H5F_get_checksums(image, chk_size, &stored_chksum, &computed_chksum);
```

`image` is a buffer of exactly `hdr->node_size` bytes — fixed, and
unrelated to `nrec`, since `get_initial_load_size` always returns
`node_size` regardless of what `nrec` claims. `H5F_get_checksums`
(`H5Fio.c:511-539`) trusts `chk_size` completely and reads that many bytes
from the buffer with no bound of its own.

**Measured:** patched a single node's own `node_nrec` field (`0xFFFF`) in
two real fixtures — one where the root is directly a leaf, one where it's
an internal node — reseal the node's own header checksum, nothing else
touched. `h5policy --profile untrusted-strict` rejects both outright, with
a *dedicated* check (`H5_CORRUPT_V2_BTREE_NODE_SIZE`, "used node bytes
exceed its declared node size") — so the field itself is not an `h5policy`
gap. Reachable via ordinary group/link iteration
(`H5Literate2`/`h5py`'s `Group.keys()`). Real consequence:

- **Stock build** (no sanitizers): fails cleanly with `H5C__load_entry():
  incorrect metadata checksum after all read attempts` — consistent with,
  not proof against, an out-of-bounds read that happened to land on other
  valid heap memory this run.
- **Fresh ASan build** (`-fsanitize=address`, built specifically to settle
  this): **crashes**, both variants, at the exact predicted line:
  ```
  AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL
  ERROR: AddressSanitizer: BUS on unknown address, caused by a READ
    #0 H5F_get_checksums              H5Fio.c:534
    #1 H5B2__cache_leaf_verify_chksum  H5B2cache.c:973   (or _int_verify_chksum, H5B2cache.c:573)
  ```
  A genuine out-of-bounds heap read — ~721KB requested against a ~512-byte
  real allocation — hard enough to hit an unmapped page rather than merely
  tripping a heap-buffer-overflow report. The unmodified seed, run through
  the identical reproducer, completes cleanly every time.

**Why this sits here and not in the main table:** `h5policy` already
independently rejects the corruption via a real, dedicated check on
`node_size`-vs-used-bytes — the *field* is fully covered. What's
uncatalogued is the *mechanism*: libhdf5's own checksum-verification step
is the thing that performs the unsafe read, with nothing — not even an
assert — standing between the raw `node_nrec` value and the read length it
drives. Same shape as `max_idx_set` above: a real, severe, currently-live
hazard in libhdf5 that a from-scratch reimplementation happens to defend
against, not a masked check that could be un-masked to fix it.

### Free-space managers — `max_sect_addr` — unbounded per-section address width, already caught by `h5policy`

`fspace->max_sect_addr` — "size of the address space free-space sections are
within (log2 of actual value)" — is decoded raw at `H5FScache.c:282`
(`UINT16DECODE`) with zero validation, not even an assert. `H5FS__sinfo_new`
(`H5FSsection.c:131`) uses it directly to compute the byte-width for *every*
section's address field for the life of the structure:

```c
sinfo->sect_off_size = (fspace->max_sect_addr + 7) / 8;
```

`H5FS__cache_sinfo_deserialize` (`H5FScache.c:1010`) then decodes each
section's address with `UINT64DECODE_VAR(image, sect_addr,
sinfo->sect_off_size)` — `DECODE_VAR` (`H5encode.h:192-201`) reads exactly
that many bytes with no cap of any kind:

```c
#define DECODE_VAR(p, n, l) \
    do { size_t _i; n = 0; (p) += l; \
         for (_i = 0; _i < l; _i++) n = (n << 8) | *(--p); \
         (p) += l; } while (0)
```

Since `max_sect_addr` is a raw `uint16_t`, it can reach 65535, making
`sect_off_size = 8192` — an 8192-byte read for a single address field,
against a real section-info buffer typically tens to low hundreds of bytes.

**Measured:** patched only `max_sect_addr` (header offset 619+44=663, 2
bytes) from 63 to `0xFFFF` in the same tracked seed used above, leaving the
section counts and list untouched.

- **`h5policy --profile untrusted-strict`: rejects outright** —
  `H5_CORRUPT_FSM_SECTION_OVERRUN` (`h5policy_walk_fspace_sections`,
  `h5_messages.pk:1166`, whose own `off_size` is computed the same way, via
  `h5policy_bytes_for_bits(max_addr_bits)`). **Not a coverage gap.**
- **Stock build** (`h5stat -s`): does not crash, but produces visibly wrong
  output — 2 of 3 real sections in the corrupted manager replaced with
  garbage "size 0" phantom entries.
- **Fresh ASan build** (reused from the V2-B-tree area, unmodified): a
  minimal C reproducer calling `H5Fget_free_sections()` crashes at the exact
  predicted line:
  ```
  AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow H5FScache.c:1010
    in H5FS__cache_sinfo_deserialize
  0x... is located 8142 bytes after 71-byte region [...]
  ```
  matching the predicted ~8192-byte width almost exactly. The unmodified
  seed runs cleanly through the identical reproducer.

**Why the sibling computation, `sinfo->nbins`, is not similarly dangerous:**
`sinfo->nbins = H5VM_log2_gen(fspace->max_sect_size)` is self-limiting —
`log2` of even a full 64-bit value tops out around 64 — while
`sect_off_size`'s linear `(max_sect_addr+7)/8` formula has no such ceiling.

**Why this sits here and not in the main table:** same shape as
`max_idx_set`/`node_nrec` above — `h5policy` already independently rejects
the corruption via a real, dedicated check computed the identical way
libhdf5 computes the dangerous width, so the *field* is fully covered.
What's uncatalogued is the *mechanism*: nothing in libhdf5 itself — not even
an assert — stands between the raw value and the read length it drives.

**Not chased further:** the *low* end of `max_sect_addr` (e.g. 0, making
`sect_off_size = 0`) — plausible as a different kind of misalignment (every
subsequent address field silently collapsing to zero-width), not
fixture-tested this round.

### Metadata-cache images — prefetched-entry deserialization — checksum verification skipped entirely by design, already caught by `h5policy`

When a metadata cache image (MDCI) is loaded, each entry's raw bytes are
copied wholesale into an in-memory "prefetched" placeholder
(`H5C__reconstruct_cache_entry`, `H5Cimage.c:2700-2899`) — bounds-checked
against the cache-image block's own buffer (`H5_IS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW`, real,
not the finding here). When the application later touches that address,
`H5C__deserialize_prefetched_entry` (`H5Centry.c:1786`) converts the
placeholder into a real typed entry. Its own comment states the design
explicitly:

```c
/* Since the size of the on disk image is known exactly, there is
 * no need for either a call to the get_initial_load_size() callback,
 * or retries if the H5C__CLASS_SPECULATIVE_LOAD_FLAG flag is set.
 * Similarly, there is no need to clamp possible reads beyond
 * EOF.
 */
len = pf_entry_ptr->size;
if (NULL == (thing = type->deserialize(pf_entry_ptr->image_ptr, len, udata, &dirty)))
    ...
```

It calls `type->deserialize()` directly — skipping the `verify_chksum` step
a normal fresh on-disk load always runs first. This is not assert-masked;
there is no assert involved at all. It is a deliberate, commented design
choice to trust cache-image content as already validated — and, measured
directly (not assumed), that trust turns out to have no real boundary in
libhdf5's own read path at all.

Three separate checksum layers are involved here, worth distinguishing
precisely: (1) the MDCI *message* itself (the cache image's declared
`addr`/`size`) lives inside a normal v2 object-header chunk, whose own
checksum genuinely is verified, like any object header's; (2) the
cache-image *block*'s own trailing checksum, computed once over the whole
block at write time (`H5C__construct_cache_image_buffer`,
`H5Cimage.c:301-304`); and (3) each individual entry's own type-specific
internal checksum (the object-header test below). Grepping every
`H5_checksum_metadata` call in `H5Cimage.c` finds both occurrences confined
to the write path (one real, one inside a debug-only self-check) — **there
is no call to verify layer 2 anywhere in the read path**, confirmed
directly: corrupting the block's own trailing checksum, without resealing
it, opens exactly as cleanly as the inner-entry test below. So libhdf5's
own read path checks neither the block-level checksum nor any individual
entry's checksum — only layer 1 (the message's own container checksum) is
real, and it protects only the address/length declaration, not the
block's actual content.

**Measured, not assumed — with a direct control-vs-mutant contrast.** Used
the tracked seed `h5policy/tests/valid/cache_image.h5` (root group +
"indexed" group + "payload" dataset; cache image with 3 real entries, all
object headers).

- **Control** (a fresh, cache-image-free file, same shape,
  `libver="latest"` to force v2 object headers): flipped one bit in the
  root group's real, on-disk object header's own trailing Jenkins
  checksum. Opening it: `RuntimeError: Unable to get group info (incorrect
  metadata checksum after all read attempts)` — cleanly rejected, as a
  normal load always is.
- **Mutant (layer 3, inner entry)** (the same seed, cache image intact):
  flipped the identical bit in the identical checksum field, but inside
  the cache-image entry's copy of that header. Resealed only the cache
  image's own outer block checksum around it (Jenkins lookup3, not
  cryptographic — trivially attacker-computable, reused from `h5mutate`).
  Opening it: **succeeds completely silently** — `h5py.File(...)` opens
  without error, and every attribute/group/dataset reads back fine.
- **Mutant (layer 2, outer block)** (the same seed again): corrupted the
  cache-image block's own trailing checksum directly, one byte, with
  **no** resealing at all. Opening it: **also succeeds completely
  silently** — confirming layer 2 is never checked either.

**`h5policy` coverage: not a gap for either layer.** `--profile
untrusted-strict` correctly rejects both mutants — the inner-entry
corruption via `H5_CORRUPT_BAD_CHECKSUM`, "object-header checksum
mismatch," at offset 48; the outer-block corruption via the same code,
"metadata cache image checksum mismatch," at offset 2766 — because
`h5policy`'s own cache-image handling independently computes and verifies
both the block's own checksum and each replayed entry's checksum against
its logical address (its README: "replays all validated cached entry
bodies through the ordinary bounded metadata decoder"). Same shape as
`node_nrec`/`max_sect_addr` above: real, severe, measured libhdf5 defects
that `h5policy` already independently defends against.

**Honest scope of the "attacker value" here.** Since Jenkins lookup3 is
not cryptographic, a fully-capable attacker constructing a file from
scratch can always compute a matching checksum for whatever bytes they
want — so this specific bypass mostly matters for *accidental* corruption
(bit-rot, torn writes, degraded storage media) rather than deliberate,
adversarial tampering. A real but different concern from "attacker injects
arbitrary content," and the two should not be conflated.

**Also checked, and retracted after review — not a finding:** swapping one
real, validly-checksummed cache-image entry's content into a *different*
entry's address slot (making the root group's cache-image entry actually
contain the "indexed" group's real content) also opens silently, and
`h5policy` also accepts it with zero findings. This was first reported as
a severe gap, but it doesn't hold up on scrutiny, for a simple reason: any
attacker who can write the file's bytes at all could get the exact same
result — a root group that directly contains what "indexed" used to
contain — just by writing an ordinary, non-cache-image file with the
honest HDF5 API. No trick, no bypass, and nothing about the result is
corrupt. So this test didn't show anything specific to how cache images
work; it only showed that an attacker who controls a file's bytes can make
the file say whatever they want, which is true of every file format and
isn't a bug on its own.

**Not chased further:** a second, independent code defect exists at
`H5Cimage.c:2820-2824` — `H5C__reconstruct_cache_entry`'s "Validate address
range" check references the entry's `size` field *before* it is decoded
three lines later (`H5Cimage.c:2829`), so it always checks against a stale
zero (`H5FL_CALLOC`-initialized) rather than the real size, meaning
`addr + size <= eoa` is never actually validated with the real size,
anywhere. Attempted to weaponize this into an EOF/EOA overrun for a
naturally-reachable entry: a naive size inflation was cleanly caught by a
*different*, correctly-implemented check (`H5_IS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW` against
the cache-image block's own buffer) in both `h5policy`
(`H5_CORRUPT_MDCI_ENTRY_OVERRUNS_IMAGE`) and the real build ("invalid
entry size"). Because the cache-image block is always allocated last in a
library-written file (at the then-current EOA), any naturally-reachable
entry's real address is inherently smaller than the cache-image block's
own address, so `entry.addr + entry.size <= entry.addr + image_len <
image_addr + image_len <= eoa` always holds structurally — the vacuous
check's absence cannot be exploited via the ordinary "natural placement"
path. Escaping that would need a hand-constructed file with the
cache-image block placed before a real object's address (not achievable
by patching a real seed), and even then the consequence is unclear, since
`addr`/`size` are just labels on an already-safe, fully-backed heap buffer
for a read-only scenario. Left as a documented, real code defect with no
demonstrated independent consequence.
