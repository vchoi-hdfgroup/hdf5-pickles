# h5policy regression runner.
#
# Oracle correctness:
#   1. (re)generates the corpus fixtures with h5policy-gencorpus,
#   2. registry consistency (tools/check_registry.py), including the gate
#      between the claimed and the measured libhdf5 verdicts,
#   3. synthetic datatype, assigned-message, file-space-info and profile-limit
#      checks; reachability records; the read-only consumer API; the
#      h5policy_analyze seam; the wrapper-generated wall-timeout report,
#   4. h5policy over every tests/expected/*.yml case, asserting the decision,
#      exit code, required findings, evidence locations and forbidden outcomes,
#   5. the differential harness against libhdf5 (h5py / h5dump / h5debug).
#
# Behaviour of the libhdf5 build under test (skipped without h5cc + cc):
#   6. exact-build probe smoke check (activation tracing),
#   7. the full h5cve expected-fixture canary matrix,
#   8. h5cve orchestrator smoke: init + triage map a finding to its invariant.
#
# Strategy-doc §12 measurements:
#   9. in-process seam self-check -- the gate on batching analyses,
#  10. bounded truncation sweep (the exhaustive one is on-demand),
#  11. lazy-validation ladders, with a sensitivity control,
#  12. the h5mutate semantic mutation families (continuation and heap).
#
# Exit status is 0 only if every check passes.
