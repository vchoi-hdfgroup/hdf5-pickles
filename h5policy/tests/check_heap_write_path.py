"""Re-measure the WRITE-path consequence of the local-heap free-list defects.

registry/cases/local-heap-free-list-bound-wraps.yml and
registry/cases/local-heap-failed-load-retains-image.yml both record a memory
error, and until this check existed neither had anything asserting it.  The
reason is structural rather than an oversight: the corpus runner, the
exact-build probe and the differential harness are all READ-ONLY by design, and
the consequence here appears only under H5F_ACC_RDWR.  A read-only traversal
never acts on the admitted free-list node.  So a libhdf5 regression -- or a
libhdf5 FIX -- was invisible to every phase of this suite.

WHAT IT MEASURES.  malformed/heap_free_list_size_wrap.h5 carries a free-list
node whose declared size wraps the additive bound at src/H5HLcache.c:258 and is
therefore published into heap->freelist.  One H5Gcreate2 then allocates from
that node, and the heap image is indexed past its allocation:

    H5HL_insert          src/H5HL.c:690    memcpy of the link NAME past the end
    H5HL__fl_serialize   src/H5HLcache.c:308-:310   the free-list encode, at flush

THE NAME LENGTH IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT, not an incidental parameter.  The
overflow needs the residual node to start past the end of the segment, so it
depends on `offset + need` against dblk_size -- 88 for this fixture.  Measured:
a 40-character name completes cleanly and a 56-character one faults.  Both are
checked here, because a fixture that stopped faulting for a reason unrelated to
libhdf5 (a regenerated corpus with a larger heap, say) would otherwise report a
silent pass.

THREE OUTCOMES, and only one is a pass:

  the long name faults      -> the recorded state.  PASS.
  the long name completes   -> either libhdf5 bounds the node now -- a real fix,
                               and the thing this check exists to notice -- or
                               the fixture's geometry drifted and the length no
                               longer crosses the bound.  FAIL, and say both.
  a CONTROL misbehaves      -> the measurement is not about the defect at all.
                               FAIL as inconclusive rather than pass vacuously.

The controls are a valid old-style group (same operation, same name length, must
complete) and the same malformed fixture with the short name (must complete).
Together they pin the fault to the length crossing the bound on a file whose
heap is otherwise usable.

Every run works on a COPY: the operation writes, and a fixture the suite
regenerates must not be mutated underneath the other phases.
