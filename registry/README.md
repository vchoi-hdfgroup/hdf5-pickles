# Invariant registry

Data-only, machine-readable description of the invariants the `h5policy` oracle
enforces, the findings it emits, and how well each record family is covered. It
is the bridge described in [*A CVE strategy for the HDF5 library*](../docs/A%20CVE%20strategy%20for%20the%20HDF5%20library.md)
between `h5policy` as an independent semantic oracle and any native
implementation: a native library can consume these invariant ids and boundaries
without importing GPLv3 pickle source into a differently-licensed build.

Registry files plus a case directory, one schema version:

| File | Answers |
|---|---|
| [`findings/`](findings/) | Authoritative finding registry: static catalog shards by record family plus grouped message-route shards for ambiguous codes. See its [maintenance guide](findings/README.md). |
| [`finding-backlog.yml`](finding-backlog.yml) | Exact source inventory for future emitted codes whose semantic record/invariant mapping is still pending. It is currently empty; an entry here is visible migration debt, not a catalog mapping. |
| [`validation-coverage.yml`](validation-coverage.yml) | For each record family: which invariants exist (per [§5](../docs/A%20CVE%20strategy%20for%20the%20HDF5%20library.md) and §11.5), which finding each maps to, where the oracle enforces it, which tests and fuzz targets cover it, and its migration status. |
| [`h5cve-matrix-policy.yml`](h5cve-matrix-policy.yml) | Which exact-build canary statuses each fixture is permitted to report. `coverage_gap` and `unexercised` are visible outcomes, never aliases for success. |
| [`message-routing.yml`](message-routing.yml) | Measured inventory of finding **messages** that resolve to no record family. A shared code's family comes from its grouped route rules, and for an `ambiguous` code a message matching no rule names no family at all. Regenerate with `python3 tools/message_routing.py --write`; `check_registry.py` fails on drift either way. |
| [`libhdf5-evidence.yml`](libhdf5-evidence.yml) | **Generated.** What the selected libhdf5 build actually did, per record family, measured by the canary matrix. |
| [`lazy-validation.json`](lazy-validation.json) | **Generated.** Measurement that validation cost tracks metadata rather than data volume, with physical-file endpoints, a sensitivity control, and the explicit latest-format/timestamps-disabled fixture policy. |
| [`truncation-sweep.json`](truncation-sweep.json) | **Generated.** Result of the §12 truncation sweep: every prefix of each seed, and whether coverage was exhaustive or sampled. |
| [`verification-coverage.yml`](verification-coverage.yml) | **Generated.** Which of the [§12](../docs/A%20CVE%20strategy%20for%20the%20HDF5%20library.md) verification requirements each record family demonstrably meets. |
| [`ssp-control-evidence.yml`](ssp-control-evidence.yml) | Checked, deliberately narrow mapping from selected HDF5 SSP controls to record/invariant/finding, fixture, canary, and exact-build measurement. It is technical evidence, not complete control attestation. |
| [`cve-case.yml`](cve-case.yml) | The annotated **template** for a per-case record. Its fields are the §11.5 containment/systemic tracking block. |
| [`cases/`](cases/) | Real per-case records, mostly `oracle-hardened` -- h5policy rejects, the libhdf5 side is unfixed -- alongside contained, upstream-fixed and proactive-hardening entries. Two are `uninvestigated`: filed divergences held as a tracked queue rather than waved through as benign. The enumeration is deliberately not spelled out here, because it drifts; `check_registry.py` counts them. |

[`../tools/check_registry.py`](../tools/check_registry.py) derives the production
emit inventory from the pickle validators and the wrapper-generated timeout
report. It requires every emitted code to appear in exactly one of the semantic
catalog or the explicit backlog, validates source attribution, and rejects
untracked or stale codes. It also enforces the cross-file constraints: every
invariant referenced by a finding or route rule exists in its record, every
required fixture finding is catalogued, every generated fixture is owned by an
expectation, and no YAML key or finding code is defined twice.

It also gates **stale citations of retired case-record fields**. When a record
renames one of its own fields, every citation of the old name elsewhere is left
dangling — and worse, may keep asserting whatever the rename retracted. That has
happened: `registry_reading_note` was renamed from an earlier heading in two
records, and three files went on citing the dead name. So the deny-list is
*derived from git history* rather than declared: every top-level field name a
record has ever carried, minus the names any record carries now, is a dead name,
and a dead name may appear only in a record that once had it — which is where the
retraction narrative belongs. Nothing has to be remembered at rename time. A dead
name too generic to word-match safely is skipped and reported by name, so the gap
is visible; outside a git checkout the whole rule reports that it is unchecked.

A separate checker, `tools/check_source_citations.py`, gates the other kind of
citation that rots silently: **a line number into one of our own pickles**. A
renamed field leaves a name to compare against, so history can catch it; a line
number leaves nothing, and stays syntactically valid while the code moves under
it. Measured when that checker was written, **all six** such citations in the
tracked tree were stale — two by more than five hundred lines, two landing on
unrelated code.

So the citation has to say what it points at, and the checker holds it to that:

```
h5_datatype.pk:1219 (member_off > elm_size)
h5_walk.pk:820 (H5_CORRUPT_SUPERBLOCK_EXTENSION_ALIAS)
h5_group.pk:194-262 (h5policy_local_heap_data_addr, data_seg_addr)
```

Every substantial token in the parenthesised anchor must appear at the cited line
(±3 lines, or anywhere inside a declared range). Prose may wrap between the
citation and its anchor, including after a `#` comment marker, but nothing else
may come between them — so a citation with no anchor cannot quietly adopt the
next parenthetical in the sentence. When a citation does break, the error names
the missing token, which turns the repair into a grep.

Citations into the **libhdf5 tree** — 343 distinct file/line pairs, in records,
expectations, pickles and generators — get a weaker gate of their own,
`tools/check_upstream_citations.py`: the file exists, the line is in range, and
the line holds something other than whitespace, a lone brace or a comment
delimiter. That is all it can check without an anchor, and the anchor is what it
cannot have. Inferring one from the surrounding prose was built and measured
first: of 842 citation occurrences, 425 name no function at all in their context,
and the mismatches were dominated by sentences carrying two citations and two
function names, which cross-match into false positives. A gate whose false
positives look like its true positives gets switched off, so this one checks only
the part that needs no annotation — and misses, by construction, a citation that
drifts onto *another statement*.

It still earns its place. Measured when it was written, against develop
`b7b85e7abf9`: **nine** distinct citations had drifted onto a blank line, a bare
brace or a comment terminator, in **sixteen** places, each one or two lines from
the statement its own prose described. None was wrong when written; upstream
inserted lines above them.

The tree is not in this repository and its location is a per-machine path that
portable provenance forbids recording, so the checker reads `HDF5_SOURCE_DIR`
(the variable the devcontainer build script already uses) and reports itself
**SKIPPED** when that is unset or does not name a checkout. A skip is not a pass
and prints as its own word; the OK line names the upstream revision it agreed
with, because a citation is only correct *against a stated tree*.

## Vocabulary (from the strategy doc)

`scope` — where the invariant is checked (§3, §11.2):
`local_decode`, `record_local`, `aggregate_object`, `reference_graph`,
`resource`, `policy`. Triage classifies the **first** incorrect security
decision, not the eventual crash site.

`severity` — the `h5policy` finding class as emitted by `h5policy_emit_error`:
`corrupt`, `resource`, `policy`, `warning`.

`ambiguous` / routes — some codes are emitted by more than one walker: a
checksum mismatch or an out-of-file address means a different thing in a chunk
index than in an object header. Those entries are marked `ambiguous: true`,
which says their top-level `record`/`invariant` name only **one** of the code's
roles and are a fallback, not an attribution.

The only per-occurrence discriminator `h5policy` reports is the finding
**message**, which is composed at the emission site. Reviewed routing for an
ambiguous code lives in a route shard that groups messages resolving to the
same role:

```yaml
routes:
  - record: chunk_index
    invariant: chunk.child_address
    scope: reference_graph
    evidence: curated
    matches:
      - "v2 B-tree chunk child address outside file"
```

The loader expands these groups and applies longest-substring-first precedence,
so a broad match cannot shadow a more specific one.

`evidence` records where a rule came from: `curated` from a fixture's own
`h5cve.family` block, `fixture` from the structure the corpus fixture that
produces the message actually corrupts. Neither is inferred from the message
text alone. A rule may name a `record` without an `invariant`: that still
selects the right exact-build canary, and the missing invariant is a visible
entry on the backlog rather than a wrong one asserted silently.

When an ambiguous code's message matches no route, `h5cve triage` asserts
**nothing** and reports the candidate records instead. An unnamed invariant is a
gap; a wrong one is a wrong fix. Adding the missing rule is the fix.

`migration_status` — `h5policy` is the oracle and enforces its invariants
independently; libhdf5 enforcement is a **separate** claim that must be proven
per §11.5, never assumed from `h5policy` accepting or rejecting.

## Current coverage

Finding and routing counts are derived rather than copied into this document:

```sh
python3 tools/finding_registry.py stats
```

The exact-build canary inventory covers every record family. Its count is
derived and checked by `tools/check_quickstart.py`; see the
[tool guide](../docs/TOOLS.md#exact-build-canary-matrix) for the current,
machine-checked inventory and its malformed-fixture contract.

Not every expectation needs its own canary contract. Alternate-profile checks,
reduced-limit integrations, and multiple expectations over one fixture can
reuse the family exercise already named by a contracted valid/malformed pair.
An uncontracted expectation never inherits a passing matrix result: the
family-level inventory is derived from the explicit contracts and fails if a
record family lacks its required canaries.

## Claimed vs measured libhdf5 behaviour

`h5policy` is the oracle and enforces its invariants independently. libhdf5
enforcement is a **separate** claim, never assumed from `h5policy` accepting or
rejecting. Two artifacts keep that claim honest:

- `validation-coverage.yml`'s `validators.hdf5` is the hand-maintained **claim**.
- `libhdf5-evidence.yml` is the **measurement**, regenerated by
  `tools/h5cve evidence` from the canary matrix (about 8 seconds).  It pins the
  build it measured in two fields, and the second one exists because the first
  is not enough: `libhdf5_version` is a bare string like `2.3.0`, and this
  repository has measured two builds of `2.3.0` five weeks apart that disagree
  about whether a defect is present.  So `libhdf5_build` carries
  `configured_on`, `build_mode`, `sanitizers` and `settings_sha256` alongside
  it.  Both are filled in from the matrix artifact by the generator —
  `--libhdf5-version` remains only as an override for an artifact produced
  before the artifact carried a build.

`check_registry.py` fails on any disagreement between them, so a verdict cannot
drift from what was observed — either the build changed and the evidence needs
regenerating, or someone asserted something nothing measured. They are separate
files on purpose: a generator that rewrites the claim it is checked against
proves nothing.

Current verdicts, against libhdf5 2.3.0:

| verdict | families |
|---|---|
| `enforced` | 7 |
| `partial` — some invariants enforced, some not | 9 |

Only `reject_corrupt` specimens count toward a verdict. Activation events
(`external_open`), crashes and hangs are recorded separately, since a build can
enforce an invariant and still crash, hang or activate on the way to it.
`crashes_on` is a fault — SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGABRT — and `hangs_on` a
non-termination the probe killed on its CPU limit; the probe spells both as a
forbidden `crash` event, so the bucket comes from its `outcome` rather than from
that name. The divergences behind the nine `partial` verdicts are written up in
[`cases/`](cases/).

## §12 verification status

[`verification-coverage.yml`](verification-coverage.yml), regenerated by
`tools/h5cve verification`, scores each family against the eleven §12
requirements. Statuses are four-valued and `not_assessed` is **not** a soft
`met`:

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `met` | mechanically demonstrated, evidence listed |
| `partial` | demonstrated for some of the requirement, not all |
| `absent` | mechanically demonstrated to be missing |
| `not_assessed` | not determinable from artifacts; needs classification |

No slot is `not_assessed` as of 2026-09-02. Every cell now says one of three
things: demonstrated, partly demonstrated, or reviewed-and-missing. A family
with no fixture for a category declares that in its record's
`verification_negatives` block, with the date it was reviewed and the reason,
and `h5cve verification` renders it `absent`. An empty annotation set with no
such declaration still renders `not_assessed`, so the mechanism cannot be used
to tidy a column -- it can only record a review that actually happened.

**68 of 176 requirement-slots are currently `met`.** None is `not_assessed`. The distribution matters
more than the total:

- OSS-Fuzz integration is the only requirement still `absent` for every family.
- Lazy validation is `met` for 2 families and `partial` for 14, and the split
  is a measurement rather than a shortfall. The counters the measurement
  asserts on -- `metadata_bytes_seen` and `walk_operations` -- are whole-walk
  totals, so there is no per-family cost signal to read. What CAN be
  established per family is that a ladder's payload growth measurably ran
  through that family's structures, and `h5policy-lazy` now attributes its
  ladders from report fields rather than from their names:
  `chunk_index_refs >= 1` at every point attributes the `filtered` ladder to
  `chunk_index`; `chunk_index_refs == 0` throughout attributes the `data`
  ladder's growing contiguous extent to `dataset_layout_filter_fill`, as does
  the decoded deflate pipeline in `filtered`. The `chunks` control is excluded
  by construction -- its metadata grows on purpose, which is what proves the
  counters are sensitive. The remaining 14 are covered by the global result and
  no more; discharging them individually needs a payload-growing ladder per
  family, and several families have no data axis to grow at all.
- Reviewed fixture/recipe annotations now carry the boundary, arithmetic,
  nesting and reference-semantics evidence outright: `not_assessed` in those
  four columns is 0, and what remains uncovered is `absent` with a reason --
  4 arithmetic, 5 nesting and 5 reference-semantics families. The annotations
  are a review of what each fixture's documented mechanism actually exercises,
  never an inference from finding-code spelling, which is why a family with many
  fixtures can still be `not_assessed` -- version, flag and checksum fixtures
  exercise none of these categories. What the sweep establishes is mostly which
  boundary VALUES the corpus lacks: `n` is thin nearly everywhere (3 families),
  `max` and `allocation_budget` reach 4 each, and `below_minimum` -- a value
  under a structure's own floor rather than one below a count -- is so far a
  single fixture.
- The 2026-09-02 sweep found that the `not_assessed` cells were mostly NOT
  missing coverage. 80 of 367 expectation files carried no `h5cve` family, and
  they included every depth and budget fixture in the tree; an uncontracted
  fixture cannot count for any family, so the arithmetic and nesting columns
  read as unassessed while the fixtures that would discharge them sat outside
  the contract. 22 were contracted, each with its canary measured first (a
  family contract puts a fixture into the matrix, so `allowed_statuses` is a
  measurement, not a guess): 15 `verified`, 5 `unexercised`, and 2 `violation`
  that earned matrix-policy overrides. Six are multi-family, because a shared
  v2-B-tree depth ceiling exercised on a client's index belongs to both. 58
  expectation files remain uncontracted; none of them is currently the only
  candidate for a `not_assessed` cell, because there are none left.
- The reviewed negatives split into two kinds, and the distinction is the
  useful part. STRUCTURAL: external links cannot nest, because h5policy decodes
  the target path and never opens it; a dataspace message is a rank byte and a
  flat array; `validation_controls` is profiles and budgets and references
  nothing; and the cache-image flush-dependency graph, which is provably
  acyclic (parents resolve only against already-indexed entries, so a cycle of
  length >= 2 needs each of two entries to precede the other). CONSTRUCTIBLE
  BUT NOT BUILT, which is the real backlog: a VDS naming itself as its own
  source, an external link naming its own file, two EFL slots sharing one heap
  name offset, and a v2-B-tree node whose child address names an ancestor --
  the cycle fixtures that exist are contracted to the CLIENTS
  (`malformed/bad_sohm_btree_cycle.h5` is a `shared_messages_legacy` fixture),
  so the shared engine's own guard has no specimen. One negative is neither:
  `address_space_bounds` has two fixtures carrying 16-byte lengths at and past
  2**64, but compatibility preflight declines the width before either value is
  decoded, so annotating them would have been vacuous.
- A negative is a claim, so it needs the same sourcing as any other. The
  cache-image nesting negative was committed on 2026-09-02 asserting the
  opposite of what `registry/cases/mdci-reconstruct-cleanup-unsafe.yml` had
  already measured, and was corrected on 2026-09-03. Read the family's case
  records before writing one, and keep each negative about the column it is in
  -- that error was cycle reasoning written into the NESTING column, where the
  self-loop fixture that settles it does not appear because it is annotated
  under reference semantics.
- Dedicated fuzz targets exist for 9 families of 16. `h5mutate` is a locator
  plus a recipe table per family, so the cost of the next family is its locator
  -- and the `v2_btree` family added on 2026-09-03 is the first whose ONE
  locator serves FOUR records: a BTHD is signature-findable with a single
  trailing checksum, and the client id in the header decides whether
  `dense_index`, `chunk_index` or `shared_messages_legacy` owns the tree while
  the geometry fields belong to `btree_heap_index`'s shared validator either
  way. Six recipes, verified on all 13 BTHD-bearing seeds in `tests/valid`
  across client ids 5, 8 and 10 -- three record layouts, not three copies of
  one file. Its locator ENUMERATES headers rather than taking the first match,
  which the `FRHP` locator can get away with and this cannot:
  `valid/sohm_btree.h5` carries a type-5 dense-link header before its type-7
  SOHM root, so a first-match locator would edit the dense-link tree while the
  sidecar claimed a SOHM target.
- The `free_space` family (2026-09-03) was chosen for a coverage reason rather
  than a cell count: h5py cannot reach free-space managers at all, so
  `h5policy-fuzz`'s oracle cannot judge an FSM mutant and a false accept there
  is undetectable by the fuzzer by construction. Six recipes over all 12
  FSHD-bearing seeds, spanning both client ids. Its headline recipe reproduces
  the `fsm-section-bin-range` defect exactly -- NDEBUG+ASan heap-buffer-overflow
  READ of size 8 in `H5FS__sect_link_size` -- which is also a reminder that the
  assert-enabled build MASKS it: `assert(bin < sinfo->nbins)` fires first and
  returns the same exit code, so the assert build alone would have read as a
  clean rejection.
- The `global_heap` family (2026-09-03) serves `virtual_dataset` and
  `message_envelope` from one locator and needs no reseal at all -- a global
  heap collection carries no checksum. Writing it exposed a shared bug in every
  locator: the superblock width offsets move with the superblock VERSION, and
  reading the version-2 pair from a version-0 superblock yields (0, 0). 20 of
  the 64 valid seeds are version 0, so this was the common case, not a corner;
  it had gone unnoticed because FRHP, BTHD and FSHD are new-format structures
  that do not appear in version-0 files, while GCOL does.
- Writing that family surfaced a MEASURED FALSE ACCEPT and a shared bug in the
  engine. The false accept is
  [`registry/cases/v2-btree-total-nrec-unchecked-in-name-walker.yml`](../registry/cases/v2-btree-total-nrec-unchecked-in-name-walker.yml):
  a dense index's total record count is never compared against the node graph
  in either name walker, because the rule is emitted from exactly one site in
  the oracle -- the creation-order walker. Zeroing it hides every link or
  attribute from every reader. Following the record's own `coverage_gaps` item
  and measuring the INFLATED direction then reversed the severity: libhdf5
  sizes its link table from the stored count and fills it from the real tree,
  so **n+1 is a stock SIGSEGV** (a NULL name left in the unfilled slot,
  dereferenced by the sort comparator) and **n-1 is a stock SIGABRT** (more
  callbacks than slots, past a write bound stated as an assert only at
  `src/H5Gdense.c:717` and compiled out of every Release build). h5policy
  accepted all of them under all four profiles. Zero is the one benign value,
  and only because a zero-sized table is never allocated.
- **Closed on the oracle side 2026-09-03.** The provenance question the record
  raised is answered: the two counts are the same number. `H5O__linfo_decode`
  sets `linfo->nlinks = HSIZET_MAX` unconditionally, so the link-info message
  stores no count at all and `H5G__obj_get_linfo` fills it from
  `H5B2_get_nrec` -- there is no second copy to cross-check, and
  `src/H5Gobj.c:330`'s "(should be same # of records in all indices)" is the
  whole of libhdf5's assurance. Both dense name walkers now compare their
  walked count against the header's stored total, via a module accumulator with
  the same abandoned-subtree sentinel the creation-order walker uses -- a short
  total from a bail would otherwise be a false positive on a file whose real
  defect caused the bail. `malformed/dense_link_btree_total_nrec.h5` pins the
  n+1 direction and h5mutate carries all three values as recipes. The libhdf5
  side stays open: it is an upstream change, and the assert at
  `src/H5Gdense.c:717` is the bound that needs to become an error return.
- The same rule was missing for the **chunk** and **SOHM** v2 B-trees, and the
  cause was a depth gate rather than an absent check: both callers compared the
  header's total against the root count, but only under `depth == 0`, so a
  leaf-root tree was checked and a deep one was not. Closed in the shared engine
  (`h5policy_walk_v2_btree_node`), which now accumulates the walked total behind
  the same abandoned-subtree sentinel the dense walkers use, with each caller
  comparing afterwards and emitting its own family's code -- one change for both
  clients, which is what the shared engine exists for. The engine bug is that all three
  locators read the size-of-offsets and size-of-lengths from fixed byte offsets
  9 and 10, which is wrong whenever a user block pushes the superblock past
  byte 0; the self-validating design caught it as a checksum failure rather
  than mutating the wrong field silently, but no family could run on a
  userblock seed. Both now read the real superblock, and `heap_structures`
  gained `valid/userblock_latest.h5` (0 -> 4 passing recipes) with no change on
  the seeds it was already verified against.
  A recipe is only counted once it emits its intended finding on seeds other
  than the one it was written against -- the heap recipes were verified on four
  structurally different heaps, and a fifth candidate was rejected for failing
  that bar.
- 14 families pin evidence locations as well as finding codes; the remaining
  2 need cursor arithmetic at the emit site rather than test metadata.
- Truncation is `met` for 12 families, `partial` for 4 whose seed exceeds the
  sweep budget, and `absent` for 0; see
  [`truncation-sweep.json`](truncation-sweep.json).
- No-activation-on-failure is `met` for 8 families and `partial` for 8 because
  the exact-build probe observes an activation or crash in those families.
  `external_file_list` joined that list on 2026-08-24 without libhdf5 changing:
  the probe's fallback single-element read moved from the origin to the last
  element, and the wrapped EFL segment it now reaches is opened before it is
  rejected. A count that goes DOWN because the harness asks a harder question is
  the intended direction -- see
  the EFL entry under [`cases/`](cases/). `message_envelope` joined on
  2026-09-02 for the same kind of reason -- not a libhdf5 change, but the
  regenerated matrix picking up `malformed/attr_gheap_free_undersized.h5`,
  whose global-heap free-space sentinel never terminates.

`check_registry.py` enforces the report's structure — every manifest record
present and every requirement scored — and derives the summary counts above.
It does not require any particular grade. Gating on the grades would be
permanently red and therefore ignored; the file is a distance measure.
